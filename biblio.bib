abstract = {Concepts like the 100-year flood event can be misleading if they are not updated to reflect significant changes over time. Here, we model observed annual maximum daily streamflow using a nonstationary approach to provide the first global picture of changes in: (a) the magnitudes of the 20-, 50-, and 100-year floods (i.e., flows of a given exceedance probability in each year); (b) the return periods of the 20-, 50-, and 100-year floods, as assessed in 1970 (i.e., flows of a fixed magnitude); and (c) corresponding flood probabilities. Empirically, we find the 20-/50-year floods have mostly increased in temperate climate zones, but decreased in arid, tropical, polar, and cold zones. In contrast, 100-year floods have mostly decreased in arid/temperate zones and exhibit mixed trends in cold zones, but results are influenced by the small number of stations with long records, and highlight the need for continued updating of hazard assessments.},

abstract = {During the detailed excavations of ancient Caesarea, Israel, East Mediterranean, 64 coastal water wells have been examined that date from the early Roman period (with the oldest occurring in the 1st century AD), up to the end of the Crusader period (mid-13th century AD). The depths of these coastal water wells establish the position of the ancient water table and therefore the position of sea level for the first century AD up to 1300 AD. The connection between the coastal water table and changes in sea level has been established from modern observations in several wells on time scales of days and months and this is used to reconstruct sea level during historical time. The results indicate that during the Byzantine period, sea level at Caesarea was higher by about 30 cm than today. The Late Moslem and Crusader data shows greater fluctuations but the data sets are also much smaller than for the earlier periods. The consistency of the data indicates that the near-coastal well data from Caesarea provides a reliable indicator of sea-level change, with an accuracy of about 10-15 cm. These results are consistent with observations for earlier periods and, with comparisons to model-predicted glacio-hydro isostatic sea-level change, indicate that ocean volumes have been constant for much of the past 2000 years. The well data is also consistent with an absence of significant vertical tectonic movement of the coast at Caesarea over about 2000 years. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Nikora1997,
abstract = {Moving sand waves and the overlying tubulent flow were measured on the Wilga River in Poland, and the Tirnava Mica and Buzau Rivers in Romania. Bottom elevations and flow velocities were measured at six points simultaneously by multi-channel measuring systems. From these data, the linear and two-dimensional sections of the three-dimensional correlation and structure functions and various projections of sand wave three-dimensional spectra were investigated. It was found that the longitudinal wavenumber spectra of the sand waves in the region of large wavenumbers followed Hino's - 3 law (S(Kx) ∝ K-3x) quite satisfactorily, confirming the theoretical predictions of Hino (1968) and Jain {\&} Kennedy (1974). However, in contrast to Hino (1968), the sand wave frequency spectrum in the high-frequency region was approximated by a power function with the exponent - 2, while in the lower-frequency region this exponent is close to - 3. A dispersion relation for sand waves has been investigated from analysis of structure functions, frequency spectra and the cross-correlation functions method. For wavelengths less than 0.15-0.25 of the flow depth, their propagation velocity C is inversely proportional to the wavelength $\lambda$. When the wavelengths of spectral components are as large as 3-4 times the flow depth, no dispersion occurs. These results proved to be in good qualitative agreement with the theoretical dispersion relation derived from the potential-flow-based analytical models (Kennedy 1969; Jain {\&} Kennedy 1974). We also present another, physically-based, explanation of this phenomenon, introducing two types of sand movement in the form of sand waves. The first type (I) is for the region of large wavenumbers (small wavelengths) and the second one (II) is for the region of small wavenumbers (large wavelengths). The small sand waves move due to the motion of individual sand particles (type I, C ∝ $\lambda$-1) while larger sand waves propagate as a result of the motion of smaller waves on their upstream slopes (type II, C ∝ $\lambda$0). Like the sand particles in the first type, these smaller waves redistribute sand from upstream slopes to downstream ones. Both types result in sand wave movement downstream but with a different propagation velocity. The main characteristics of turbulence, as well as the quantitative values characterizing the modulation of turbulence by sand waves, are also presented.},

@article{Church2010,
abstract = {Modern geomorphology was founded in the nineteenth century as an exercise of historical interpretation of landscapes. After the mid-twentieth century it dominantly became a quest to understand the processes by which landscapes are modified. This focused attention on the measurement of sediment fluxes on synoptic timescales and on a reductionist, Newtonian programme of construction of low-order theories about those fluxes, largely imported from engineering science. The period also saw the emergence of an applied geomorphology. Toward the end of the twentieth century the subject was dramatically transformed by improved technologies for remote sensing and surveying of Earth's surface, the advent of personal computation and of large-scale computation, and important developments of absolute dating techniques. These technical innovations in turn promoted recognition of geomorphology as a 'system science' and facilitated the reintegration of tectonics into geomorphology, opening the way for a renewed consideration of the history of the landscape. Finally, increasing recognition of the dominance of human agency in contemporary modification of Earth's terrestrial surface has become a significant theme. Important influences on the continuing development of the subject will include the search for physically sound laws for material fluxes; reconciling geomorphological information and process representations across spatial and temporal scales, in both observation and theory; comprehending complexity in geomorphological processes and landform histories; incorporating the geomorphological role of living organisms, particularly micro-organisms; understanding the role of climate in geomorphology, both in the contemporary changing climate and in the long term; and fully admitting the now dominant role of humans as geomorphic agents. Geomorphology is simultaneously developing in diverse directions: on one hand, it is becoming a more rigorous geophysical science - a significant part of a larger earth science discipline; on another, it is becoming more concerned with human social and economic values, with environmental change, conservation ethics, with the human impact on environment, and with issues of social justice and equity. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2010.},

abstract = {Fluvial bedrock incision is driven by the impact of moving bedload particles. Mechanistic, sediment-flux-dependent incision models have been proposed, but the stream power incision model (SPIM) is frequently used to model landscape evolution over large spatial and temporal scales. This disconnect between the mechanistic understanding of fluvial bedrock incision on the process scale, and the way it is modeled on long time scales presents one of the current challenges in quantitative geomorphology. Here, a mechanistic model of fluvial bedrock incision that is rooted in current process understanding is explicitly upscaled to long time scales by integrating over the distribution of discharge. The model predicts a channel long profile form equivalent to the one yielded by the SPIM, but explicitly resolves the effects of channel width, cross-sectional shape, bedrock erodibility, and discharge variability. The channel long profile chiefly depends on the mechanics of bedload transport, rather than bedrock incision. In addition to the imposed boundary conditions specifying the upstream supply of water and sediment, and the incision rate, the model includes four free parameters, describing the at-a-station hydraulic geometry of channel width, the dependence of bedload transport capacity on channel width, the threshold discharge of bedload motion, and reach-scale cover dynamics. For certain parameter combinations, no solutions exist. However, by adjusting the free parameters, one or several solutions can usually be found. The controls on and the feedbacks between the free parameters have so far been little studied, but may exert important controls on bedrock channel morphology and dynamics.},

abstract = {Major changes in the morphology of the Trinity River in California, such as narrowing of the cross section and sedimentation of fine sediment in pools, occurred after the closure of a system of dams. These changes caused a dramatic reduction in the salmonid population and a resulting decline of the fishery. Gravel augmentation, regulated flood releases, and mechanical channel rehabilitation are currently being implemented to help restore the aquatic habitat of the river. The present paper describes a tool, named the Spawning Gravel Refresher, for designing and predicting the effects of gravel augmentation in gravel bed rivers. The tool assumes an imposed, cycled hydrograph. The model is calibrated and applied to the regulated reach of the Trinity River in four steps: (1) zeroing runs to reproduce conditions of mobile bed equilibrium as best can be estimated for the predam Trinity River, (2) runs to compare the predictions with the results of previous studies, (3) runs at an engineering time scale to reproduce the effects of the dams, and (4) runs to design gravel augmentation schemes. In the fourth group of runs, the combined effects of engineered flood flow releases and gravel augmentation are predicted. At an engineering time scale, the model indicates that the fraction of fine sediment in the surface layer and in the topmost part of the substrate should decrease when subjected to these two restoration measures, with a consequent improvement of the quality of the spawning gravel.

The renormalization group is then developed in some detail, and applied to a variety of systems. The main dynamic universality classes are identified and characterized. It is found that the mode-coupling and renormalization group theories successfully explain available experimental data at the critical point of pure fluids, and binary mixtures, and at many magnetic phase transitions, but that a number of discrepancies exist with data at the superfluid transition of He4. {\textcopyright} 1977 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {A model for cells structured by size undergoing growth and division leads to an initial boundary value problem that involves a first-order linear partial differential equation with a functional term. Here, size can be interpreted as DNA content or mass. It has been observed experimentally and shown analytically that solutions for arbitrary initial cell distributions are asymptotic as time goes to infinity to a certain solution called the steady size distribution. The full solution to the problem for arbitrary initial distributions, however, is elusive owing to the presence of the functional term and the paucity of solution techniques for such problems. In this paper, we derive a solution to the problem for arbitrary initial cell distributions. The method employed exploits the hyperbolic character of the underlying differential operator, and the advanced nature of the functional argument to reduce the problem to a sequence of simple Cauchy problems. The existence of solutions for arbitrary initial distributions is established along with uniqueness. The asymptotic relationship with the steady size distribution is established, and because the solution is known explicitly, higher-order terms in the asymptotics can be readily obtained.},

We demonstrate that the critical Stokes number for the bouncing transition, is the sum of two contributions corresponding to dissipation prior to and during the collision, both contributions being critically influenced by the geometrical parameters of the model roughness. The experimental data obtained from interferometric measurements are found to be in agreement with the theoretical predictions.

abstract = {We describe the probabilistic physics of rarefied particle motions and deposition on rough hillslope surfaces. The particle energy balance involves gravitational heating with conversion of potential to kinetic energy, frictional cooling associated with particle-surface collisions, and an apparent heating associated with preferential deposition of low-energy particles. Deposition probabilistically occurs with frictional cooling in relation to the distribution of particle energy states whose spatial evolution is described by a Fokker-Planck equation. The Kirkby number Ki - defined as the ratio of gravitational heating to frictional cooling - sets the basic deposition behavior and the form of the probability distribution fr(r) of particle travel distances r, a generalized Pareto distribution. The shape and scale parameters of the distribution are well-defined mechanically. For isothermal conditions where frictional cooling matches gravitational heating plus the apparent heating due to deposition, the distribution fr(r) is exponential. With non-isothermal conditions and small Ki this distribution is bounded and represents rapid thermal collapse. With increasing Ki the distribution fr(r) becomes heavy-tailed and represents net particle heating. It may possess a finite mean and finite variance, or the mean and variance may be undefined with sufficiently large Ki. The formulation provides key elements of the entrainment forms of the particle flux and the Exner equation, and it clarifies the mechanisms of particle-size sorting on large talus and scree slopes. Namely, with conversion of translational to rotational kinetic energy, large spinning particles are less likely to be stopped by collisional friction than are small or angular particles for the same surface roughness.},

abstract = {By the late nineteenth century, the scientific study of bedload transport had emerged as an offshoot of hydraulics and geomorphology. Since then, computing bedload transport rates has attracted considerable attention, but whereas other environmental sciences have seen their predictive capacities grow over time, particularly thanks to increased computing power, engineers and scientists are unable to predict bedload transport rates to within better than one order of magnitude. Why have we failed to improve our predictive capacity to any significant degree? A commonly shared view is that the study of bedload transport has more in common with the earth sciences than hydraulics: bedload transport rates depend on many processes that vary nonlinearly, involve various time and space scales, and are interrelated to each other. All this makes it difficult to view bedload as merely particle transport in a turbulent flow–something which can be studied in the laboratory in isolation from the natural environment. Over the last two decades, more emphasis has been put on the noisy dynamics characterizing bedload transport. This Vision Paper makes a strong case for recognizing noise (e.g. bedload transport rate fluctuations) as an intrinsic feature of bedload transport. Improving our predictive capacities requires a better understanding of the origins and nature of noise in bedload transport. This paper also reviews some of the challenges that need to be addressed in current research and teaching.},

abstract = {Viscous damping is known to play a critical role in determining the restitution coefficient for the collision of two spherical particles at low and moderate Stokes numbers due to fluid motion in the squeeze-film between the particles. The classical expression for the viscous damping force of approaching spheres, valid prior to collision of the particles, has been used by several investigators to model the effect of viscous damping on the restitution coefficient. However, viscous damping also occurs during the particle collision due to the corner flow associated with a change in the radius of the contact region, within which the particle surfaces deform into flattened parallel surfaces due to high fluid pressure within the squeeze-film. The current paper derives a simple expression for the fluid damping force caused by the squeeze-film dynamics associated with a change in the contact region radius during collision. This expression is then used in conjunction with the damping force expression for spherical particles before and after collision to predict the variation of restitution coefficient with the particle Stokes number and elasticity parameter. The viscous damping force during collision exhibits sensitive dependence on the minimum approach distance separating the particle surfaces within the contact region, which, in turn, is controlled by factors such as microscopic particle surface roughness and pressure-dependent density and viscosity changes of the fluid. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {A general expression is derived for the fluid force on a body of simple shape moving with a velocity v through inviscid fluid in which there is an unsteady non-uniform rotational velocity field u0(x, t) in two or three dimensions. It is assumed that the radius is small compared with the scale over which the strain rate changes, though for the sphere it is also assumed that the changes in the ambient velocity field over the scale of the sphere are small compared with the velocity of the body relative to the flow. Given these approximations it is shown that the effects of the rate of change of the vorticity of the ambient flow is of second order and can be neglected. However the rate of change of the irrotational straining motion is included in the analysis. It is shown that the inertial forces derived by many authors for irrotational flow can be simply added to a generalization of the lift force derived by Auton (1987) in a companion paper. It is shown how this lift force is made up of a rotational and an inertial or added-mass component. For three-dimensional bluff bodies the latter is generally larger (by a factor of three for a sphere), and can be simply calculated from the added-mass coefficient. For illustration, the general expression is used to derive formulae for (i) the motion of a spherical bubble in a steady non-uniform flow to contrast with the motion in an unsteady flow, and (ii) the motion of rigid volumes of neutral density across an inviscid shear flow. These results show how added-mass (and lift) forces lead to different motions for a sphere and a cylinder. The general expression is useful in two-phase flow calculations, and for indicating the forces and motions of ‘lumps of fluid' in turbulent flows. {\textcopyright} 1988, Cambridge University Press.

abstract = {Abrasion by bed load is a ubiquitous and sometimes dominant erosional mechanism for fluvial incision into bedrock. Here we develop a model for bedrock abrasion by saltating bed load wherein the wear rate depends linearly on the flux of impact kinetic energy normal to the bed and on the fraction of the bed that is not armored by transient deposits of alluvium. We assume that the extent of alluvial bed cover depends on the ratio of coarse sediment supply to bed load transport capacity. Particle impact velocity and impact frequency depend on saltation trajectories, which can be predicted using empirical functions of excess shear stress. The model predicts a nonlinear dependence of bedrock abrasion rate on both sediment supply and transport capacity. Maximum wear rates occur at moderate relative supply rates due to the tradeoff between the availability of abrasive tools and the partial alluviation of the bedrock bed. Maximum wear rates also occur at intermediate levels of excess shear stress due to the reduction in impact frequency as grain motion approaches the threshold of suspension. Measurements of bedrock wear in a laboratory abrasion mill agree well with model predictions and allow calibration of the one free model parameter, which relates rock strength to rock resistance to abrasive wear. The model results suggest that grain size and sediment supply are fundamental controls on bedrock incision rates, not only by bed load abrasion but also by all other mechanisms that require bedrock to be exposed in the channel bed.},

The tracers captured ≈6 orders of temporal magnitude of rest durations in one data set for the first time. Motions and rests suggest a scaling transition around ≈12.5 min from subdiffusion to superdiffusion with increasing shear stress and timescale. We interpret that diurnal hydrograph cyclicity may cause another diffusion scaling break at ≈12 h. Shear stress controls and scaling uncertainties may explain differences in diffusion exponents found in several field data sets, suggesting that gravel superdiffusion scaling may be relatively universal over minutes to seasons. Methodologically, “smartrocks” can quantify field transport probabilities previously only possible in laboratory experiments.},

abstract = {There is a common acceptance that the Anthropocene epoch is characterized by the increasing dominance of human activity as a driver of global terrestrial change. Geomorphology, with its historical roots in geology and geography, would seem to be ideally positioned as a geoscience to tackle the well documented, rapidly degrading health of that environment. However, the word ‘geomorphology' is problematic outside the academy in a way that ‘landscape' is not. A more explicit identification of geomorphology as a landscape science would encourage engagement by geomorphologists in one of the most urgent environmental questions of our time. If humanity is indeed the most important driver of environmental change, we propose that geomorphologists need to engage more seriously with the cognate landscape sciences, such as landscape architecture, anthropology and political ecology. In particular, there are landscapes that are more threatened than others and critical zones in landscapes that must be protected and enhanced with greater care than others. We argue that recasting geomorphology as not only a geoscience but also a landscape science would highlight issues of human well-being at different spatio-temporal scales and we illustrate this in three case studies from our respective countries: UK, Canada and Austria. As traditional geoscientists, we are not used to thinking of coastal flooding, permafrost degradation and snow depletion as centrally important to our science. But as landscape scientists the inclusion of these and all other components of the cryosphere's interaction with human wellbeing is entirely logical and the distinction between systemic and cumulative environmental responses provides a key to unravelling the variable contributions of local actors, managers and decision makers to environmental degradation. Decision making at zonal, regional and local scales are integral to the way in which geomorphic systems function. This argument clearly has wider application. It is up to geomorphology, acting as a landscape science, to provide the underpinning principles that identify landscape-changing actions as being unsustainable and in providing better-informed future pathways away from such actions.},

abstract = {Researchers have associated channel-forming flows with reach-average shear stresses close to the entrainment threshold for the surface D50. We conducted experiments using a model of a generic steep, gravel–cobble stream to test this association. Our results suggest that channel-forming flows fully mobilize the D50, and produce shear stresses close to the entrainment threshold for the largest grains in the bed. The channel dimensions were set by flows capable of mobilizing between 85{\%} and 90{\%} of the bed surface, which produced a brief period of lateral instability lasting about 1 h, followed by a prolonged period of relative stability during which modest adjustments occurred, but during which the reach-average hydraulics remained about the same. The adjustments during the unstable phase of the experiments are characterized by rapid bank erosion, extensive deposits on the channel bed and a restructuring of the major morphologic elements of the stream. The adjustments during the stable phase of the experiments involved barform migration and bed surface coarsening but did not appreciably modify the physical template established by the end of the unstable phase. The behaviour we observed is not consistent with the concept of a dynamic equilibrium associated with a formative flow that is just capable of entraining the bed surface D50. Instead, it suggests that rapid adjustments occur once a stability threshold is exceeded, which creates a template that constrains channel activity until another event drives the system across the stability threshold, and re-sets the template. While we believe that it is probably too simplistic to associate a channel-forming discharge with the entrainment threshold for a single grain size, our results suggest that the D95 is a more logical choice than the D50 {\textcopyright} 2020 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

This mobilization is due to the action of fluid forces on the exposed grains. Substrate particles can participate in the bedload only to the extent that local or global scour results in their exposure on the surface. It follows that a calculation of the bedload transport rate of mixtures should be based on the availability of each size range in the surface layer.

The understanding of the origin of such bursty patterns is hindered by the lack of tools to compare different systems using a common framework. Here we propose to characterize the bursty nature of real signals using orthogonal measures quantifying two distinct mechanisms leading to burstiness: the interevent time distribution and the memory. We find that while the burstiness of natural phenomena is rooted in both the interevent time distribution and memory, for human dynamics memory is weak, and the bursty character is due to the changes in the interevent time distribution. Finally, we show that current models lack in their ability to reproduce the activity pattern observed in real systems, opening up avenues for future work. {\textcopyright} Europhysics Letters Association.},

abstract = {We present a general framework to study the distribution of the flux through the origin up to time t, in a noninteracting one-dimensional system of particles with a step initial condition with a fixed density $\rho$ of particles to the left of the origin. We focus principally on two cases: (i) particles undergoing diffusive dynamics (passive case) and (ii) run-and-tumble dynamics for each particle (active case). In analogy with disordered systems, we consider the flux distribution for both the annealed and the quenched initial conditions, for passive and active particles. In the annealed case, we show that, for arbitrary particle dynamics, the flux distribution is a Poissonian with a mean $\mu$(t) that we compute exactly in terms of the Green's function of the single-particle dynamics. For the quenched case, we show that, for the run-and-tumble dynamics, the quenched flux distribution takes an anomalous large-deviation form at large times, Pqu(Q,t)∼exp-$\rho$v0$\gamma$t2$\psi$RTPQ$\rho$v0t, where $\gamma$ is the rate of tumbling and v0 is the ballistic speed between two successive tumblings. In this paper, we compute the rate function $\psi$RTP(q) and show that it is nontrivial. Our method also gives access to the probability of the rare event that, at time t, there is no particle to the right of the origin. For diffusive and run-and-tumble dynamics, we find that this probability decays with time as a stretched exponential, ∼exp(-ct), where the constant c can be computed exactly. We verify our results for these large deviations by using an importance sampling Monte Carlo method.},

The experiment is prototypical of sediment transport on sloping beds. Similar to the earlier experimental results on fine particles entrained by a turbulent stream, we found that most features of the particle motion were controlled by a dimensionless shear stress (also called the Shields number) [formula presented] defined as the ratio of the bottom shear stress exerted by the water flow to the buoyant weight of the particle (scaled by its cross-sectional area to obtain a stress). We did not observe a clear transition from rest to motion, but on the contrary there was a fairly wide range of [formula presented] (typically [formula presented] for gentle slopes) for which the particle could be set in motion or come to rest. When the particle was set in motion, it systematically began to roll. The rolling regime was marginal in that it occurred for a narrow range of [formula presented] (typically [formula presented] for gentle slopes). For sufficiently high Shields numbers [formula presented] the particle was in saltation. The mean particle velocity was found to vary linearly with the square root of the bottom shear stress and here, surprisingly enough, was a decreasing function of the channel slope. We also performed numerical simulations based on Lagrangian equations of motion. A qualitative agreement was found between the experimental data and numerical simulations but, from a quantitative point of view, the relative deviation was sometimes substantial (as high as [formula presented] An explanation for the partial agreement is the significant modification in the water flow near the particle. {\textcopyright} 2002 The American Physical Society.},

By varying the Shields number (the nondimensional shear stress at the top of the bed) and particle Reynolds number (the ratio of particle inertia to viscous damping), we explore how variations of the fluid flow rate, particle inertia, and fluid viscosity affect the onset and cessation of bed motion. For low to moderate particle Reynolds numbers, a critical boundary separates mobile and static states. Transition times between these states diverge as this boundary is approached both from above and below. At high particle Reynolds number, inertial effects become dominant, and particle motion can be sustained well below flow rates at which mobilization of a static bed occurs. We also find that the onset of bed motion (for both low and high particle Reynolds numbers) is described by Weibullian weakest-link statistics and thus is crucially dependent on the packing structure of the granular bed, even deep beneath the surface.},

Some of the early work on the equation of motion, as well as recent advances, are exposed. Particular emphasis is placed on the semiempirical forms of the equation, which are widely used in engineering practice. The creeping flow assumption, on which most of the known applications are based, is critically examined and its limitations are pointed out. Recent results on particle flow, which include the effect of the advection of a downstream wake and are applicable to finite (but small) Reynolds numbers are also presented. The form of the history (Basset) term is discussed, in the light of recent work and its effect on the integrated results of the equation of motion is examined.

A matched asymptotic solution is obtained for the frequency-dependent (or the acceleration-dependent) part of the unsteady flow at very small frequency,$\omega$, under the restriction St {\textless}{\textless}Re {\textless}1, where St is the Strouhal number. The acceleration-dependent part of the unsteady drag is found to be proportional to St {\~{}} $\omega$instead of the $\omega$12 dependence predicted by Stokes‘ solution. Consequently, the expression for the Basset history force is incorrect for large time even for very small Reynolds numbers. Present results compare well with the previous numerical results of Mei, Lawrence {\&} Adrian (1991) using a finite-difference method for the same unsteady flow at small Reynolds number. Using the principle of causality, the present analytical results at small Re, the numerical results at finite Re for low frequency, and Stokes'results for high frequency, a modified expression for the history force is proposed in the time domain. It is confirmed by comparing with the finite-difference results at arbitrary frequency through Fourier transformation. The modified history force has an integration kernel that decays as t-2, instead of t-1/2, at large time for both small and finite Reynolds numbers. {\textcopyright} 1992, Cambridge University Press.

@article{Hunt2002,
abstract = {In 1954 R. A. Bagnold published his seminal findings on the rheological properties of a liquid-solid suspension. Although this work has been cited extensively over the last fifty years, there has not been a critical review of the experiments. The purpose of this study is to examine the work and to suggest an alternative reason for the experimental findings. The concentric cylinder rheometer was designed to measure simultaneously the shear and normal forces for a wide range of solid concentrations, fluid viscosities and shear rates. As presented by Bagnold, the analysis and experiments demonstrated that the shear and normal forces depended linearly on the shear rate in the 'macroviscous' regime; as the grain-to-grain interactions increased in the 'grain-inertia' regime, the stresses depended on the square of the shear rate and were independent of the fluid viscosity. These results, however, appear to be dictated by the design of the experimental facility. In Bagnold's experiments, the height (h) of the rheometer was relatively short compared to the spacing (t) between the rotating outer and stationary inner cylinder (h/t = 4.6). Since the top and bottom end plates rotated with the outer cylinder, the flow contained two axisymmetric counter-rotating cells in which flow moved outward along the end plates and inward through the central region of the annulus. At higher Reynolds numbers, these cells contributed significantly to the measured torque, as demonstrated by comparing Bagnold's pure-fluid measurements with studies on laminar-to-turbulent transitions that pre-date the 1954 study. By accounting for the torque along the end walls, Bagnold's shear stress measurements can be estimated by modelling the liquid-solid mixture as a Newtonian fluid with a corrected viscosity that depends on the solids concentration. An analysis of the normal stress measurements was problematic because the gross measurements were not reported and could not be obtained.},

abstract = {Dispersions of solid spherical grains of diameter D = 0.13cm were sheared in Newtonian fluids of varying viscosity (water and a glycerine-water-alcohol mixture) in the annular space between two concentric drums. The density $\sigma$ of the grains was balanced against the density $\rho$ of the fluid, giving a condition of no differential forces due to radial acceleration. The volume concentration C of the grains was varied between 62 and 13 {\%}. A substantial radial dispersive pressure was found to be exerted between the grains. This was measured as an increase of static pressure in the inner stationary drum which had a deformable periphery. The torque on the inner drum was also measured. The dispersive pressure P was found to be proportional to a shear stress $\lambda$ attributable to the presence of the grains. The linear grain concentration $\lambda$ is defined as the ratio grain diameter/mean free dispersion distance and is related to C by $\lambda$ = 1 ( C 0 / C ) 1 2 − 1 where C 0 is the maximum possible static volume concentration. Both the stresses T and P , as dimensionless groups T $\sigma$ D 2 /$\lambda$$\eta$ 2 , and P $\sigma$ D 2 /$\lambda$$\eta$ 2 , were found to bear single-valued empirical relations to a dimensionless shear strain group $\lambda$ ½ $\sigma$ D 2 (d U /d y )l$\eta$ for all the values of $\lambda${\textless} 12( C = 57{\%} approx.) where d U /d y is the rate of shearing of the grains over one another, and $\eta$ the fluid viscosity. This relation gives T $\alpha$ $\sigma$ ( $\lambda$ D ) 2 ( dU / dy ) 2 and T ∝ $\lambda$ 1 2 $\eta$ d U / dy according as d U /d y is large or small, i.e. according to whether grain inertia or fluid viscosity dominate. An alternative semi-empirical relation F = (1+$\lambda$)(1+½$\lambda$)$\eta$d U /d y was found for the viscous case, when T is the whole shear stress. The ratio T/P was constant at 0{\textperiodcentered}3 approx, in the inertia region, and at 0.75 approx, in the viscous region. The results are applied to a few hitherto unexplained natural phenomena.},

abstract = {The motion of a spherical particle along a rough bed in a simple shear viscous flow is studied experimentally for a wide range of parameters, varying the particle size and density, the fluid viscosity and the shear rate $\gamma$. The instantaneous particle velocity is calculated in the stream, transverse and vertical directions, using a high-speed video imaging system. It is found that the normalized streamwise mean particle velocity U/Us, where Us is the Stokes settling velocity, depends only on the dimensionless shear rate $\mu$$\gamma$/($\Delta$pgd) this relationship being independent of the particle Reynolds number (Rep {\textgreater} 10).

abstract = {Elastohydrodynamic theory and measurements of particle impacts on an inclined glass plane in water are used to investigate the mechanics of interparticle collisions in sediment-transporting flows. A collision Stokes number is proposed as a measure of the momentum of an interparticle collision versus the viscous pressure force in the interstitial gap between colliding particles. The viscous pressure force opposes motion of the particles on approach and rebound. A Stokes number of between 39 and 105 is estimated as the critical range below which particle impacts are completely viscously damped and above which impacts are partially elastic. The critical Stokes number is shown to roughly coincide with the Bagnold number transition between macroviscous and grain inertial debris flows and the transition between damped and partially elastic bed load transport saltation impacts. The nonspherical nature of natural particles significantly alters the motion of the center of mass after a partially elastic collision. The normal to the point of contact between the particles does not necessarily go through the center of mass. Thus normal rebound of the center of mass may not occur. A model of particle motion after rebound for particles of arbitrary shape, conserving both linear and angular momentum, is proposed.},

For a homogeneous granular gas of identical particles, the corresponding decay of granular temperature is quantified by Haff's law. Here, we report that for a granular gas of aggregating particles, the granular temperature does not necessarily decay but may even increase. Surprisingly, the increase of temperature is accompanied by the continuous loss of total gas energy. This stunning effect arises from a subtle interplay between decaying kinetic energy and gradual reduction of the number of degrees of freedom associated with the particles' dynamics. We derive a set of kinetic equations of Smoluchowski type for the concentrations of aggregates of different sizes and their energies. We find scaling solutions to these equations and a condition for the aggregation mechanism predicting growth of temperature.

abstract = {This paper presents experimental measurements of the approach and rebound of a particle colliding with a wall in a viscous fluid. The particle's trajectory was controlled by setting the initial inclination angle of a pendulum immersed in a fluid. The resulting collisions were monitored using a high-speed video camera. The diameters of the particles ranged from 3 to 12 mm, and the ratio of the particle density to fluid density varied from 1.2 to 7.8. The experiments were performed using a thick glass or Lucite wall with different mixtures of glycerol and water. With these parameters, the Reynolds number defined using the velocity just prior to impact ranged from 10 to approximately 3000. A coefficient of restitution was defined from the ratio of the velocity just prior to and after impact. The experiments clearly demonstrate that the rebound velocity depends on the impact Stokes number (defined from the Reynolds number and the density ratio) and weakly on the elastic properties of the material. Below a Stokes number of approximately 10, no rebound of the particle occurred. For impact Stokes number above 500 the coefficient of restitution appears to asymptote to the values for dry collisions. The coefficient of restitution were also compared with previous experimental studies. In addition, the approach of the particle to the wall indicated that the particle slowed prior to impacting the surface. The distance at which the particle's trajectory varied due to the presence of the wall was dependent on the impact Stokes number. The particle surface roughness was found to affect the repeatability of some measurements, especially for low impact velocities.},

abstract = {Aeolian processes involve the wind action on a sedimentary substrate, namely erosion, sand transport and deposition. They are responsible for the emergence of aeolian dunes and ripples but also erosive structures like yardangs. In this review, we discuss the physics of aeolian sediment transport from a physical point of view. Relevant time and length scales associated to turbulent wind fluctuations are summarized using aerodynamic theory. At the microscopic scale, the different forces acting on the grains are detailed. We then introduce the concepts - e.g. saturated flux, saturation length - and the relevant framework for the development of a continuum quantitative description of transport. Static and dynamical entrainment thresholds are modeled and discussed. Steady transport is investigated in two asymptotic regimes: close to threshold and far above it. In both cases, a simple picture, taking into account the negative feedback of particles on the wind flow, is analytically drawn and compared to experimental and numerical data. The low wind velocity regime corresponds to the model proposed by Ungar and Haff (1987) and the high wind velocity regime is elaborated from initial ideas of Bagnold (1941). Transport transient is also studied in detail, and scaling laws for the saturation length are proposed. Finally, some open issues for future research are outlined in the conclusion. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A minimalist stochastic model of primary soil salinity is proposed, in which the rate of soil salinization is determined by the balance between dry and wet salt deposition and the intermittent leaching events caused by rainfall events. The long term probability density functions of salt mass and concentration are found by reducing the coupled soil moisture and salt mass balance equation to a single stochastic differential equation driven by multiplicative Poisson noise. The novel analytical solutions provide insight on the interplay of the main soil, plant and climate parameters responsible for long, term soil salinization. In particular, they show the existence of two distinct regimes, one where the mean salt mass remains nearly constant (or decreases) with increasing rainfall frequency, and another where mean salt content increases markedly with increasing rainfall frequency. As a result, relatively small reductions of rainfall in drier climates may entail dramatic shifts in long-term soil salinization trends, with significant consequences e.g. for climate change impacts on rain-fed agriculture. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.},

In this review, we report the current state of the art of bed particle saltation in turbulent wall-shear flow, highlighting the physical characteristics of bed particle saltation and its mathematical modelling. A critical appraisal of the mechanics of bed particle saltation is presented thorough ample experimental evidence. The salient features of bed particle saltation, encompassing the saltation height, saltation length, particle velocity, saltation duration, particle collision with the bed, particle rotation, particle resting time and particle re-entrainment, are thoroughly discussed. Both the deterministic and computational fluid dynamics approaches in modelling bed particle saltation are summarized, and the subtle role of the hydrodynamic forces is elaborated. The estimation of bedload flux in a fluvial environment, emanating from the mathematical modelling of bed particle saltation, is delineated using different modelling approaches. Finally, the challenges in modelling bed particle saltation are highlighted, and a new look at bed particle saltation is furnished.},

abstract = {Predicting the morphodynamics of sedimentary landscapes due to fluvial and aeolian flows requires answering the following questions: Is the flow strong enough to initiate sediment transport, is the flow strong enough to sustain sediment transport once initiated, and how much sediment is transported by the flow in the saturated state (i.e., what is the transport capacity)? In the geomorphological and related literature, the widespread consensus has been that the initiation, cessation, and capacity of fluvial transport, and the initiation of aeolian transport, are controlled by fluid entrainment of bed sediment caused by flow forces overcoming local resisting forces, whereas aeolian transport cessation and capacity are controlled by impact entrainment caused by the impacts of transported particles with the bed. Here the physics of sediment transport initiation, cessation, and capacity is reviewed with emphasis on recent consensus-challenging developments in sediment transport experiments, two-phase flow modeling, and the incorporation of granular physics' concepts. Highlighted are the similarities between dense granular flows and sediment transport, such as a superslow granular motion known as creeping (which occurs for arbitrarily weak driving flows) and system-spanning force networks that resist bed sediment entrainment; the roles of the magnitude and duration of turbulent fluctuation events in fluid entrainment; the traditionally overlooked role of particle-bed impacts in triggering entrainment events in fluvial transport; and the common physical underpinning of transport thresholds across aeolian and fluvial environments. This sheds a new light on the well-known Shields diagram, where measurements of fluid entrainment thresholds could actually correspond to entrainment-independent cessation thresholds.},

The mean angle of ejection is found to be about 30° from the horizontal (rather than 90°) with mean vertical ejection velocity of about 2where w* is the frirtinn vlnritv Trajectories of saltating grains have been computed, using the measurements of the initial ejection velocities and the mean velocity profile of the air flow. The results largely agree with our measurements, and those of others, of mean values of maximum rise height, and the angles and velocities of particles at impact with the bed, including measurements of saltating snow particles. The velocity results are correlated with «+, the friction velocity. An essential point is that, even for particles as small as 100 pm, the fact that the drag law is nonlinear (i.e. non-Stokesian) means that the large horizontal mean velocity acts to increase the vertical component of drag on particles. This effect reduces the height to which they rise by 40{\%} to 50{\%} compared with the value in still air for a given vertical election velocity. Using the measured probability distribution of ejection velocities, an ensemble of trajectories was computed and thence the average horizontal velocity of particles at a given height and the vertical profiles of streamwise fluxes fz) and concentrations of sand grains over a flat bed. It was found that above the threshold wind speed /i(z) oc exp(—Agz/uW where the coefficient A varies over about 50{\%}. The rapid increase in {\textless}vt) above the mean height of the particles, and the exponential decrease with height of the computed flux profile both agree with several sets of measurements in wind tunnels and in the field (collated here for the first time). However, unanswered questions about saltation still remain. A model equation is proposed connecting the integrated horizontal flux Fx(z) = fx(z) dz, the vertical upwards flux/3Eand the average length / of trajectories.

The pantograph is modelled by two discrete masses connected by springs and dampers. Away from the supports the inertia and elasticity of the pantograph can be neglected and a simple solution for the wire and pantograph displacement is obtained. Near a support this solution is not valid as it predicts discontinuities in the vertical pantograph velocity. A different first approximation is then required in which the support elasticity and the pantograph inertia and elasticity must be included. This problem is reduced to that of solving a system of four linear differential equations containing one term with a stretched argument. The numerical and asymptotic solution of such a system is discussed and results are obtained for the contact force and pantograph displacement near a support in typical operating conditions. This disturbance at the support is propagated with the wire wave speed and reflected at the subsequent support, thus interacting with the pantograph again. This interaction is analysed and a uniformly valid solution obtained for the contact force over a complete span. Some conclusions are made about possible operating conditions in which loss of contact between the pantograph and the wire may occur.},

@article{Furbish2009,
abstract = {[1] For hillslopes undergoing "diffusive" soil transport, it is often assumed that the soil flux is proportional to the local land-surface gradient, where the coefficient of proportionality is like a diffusion coefficient. Inasmuch as transport involves quasirandom soil particle motions related to biomechanical mixing and similar dilational processes, a slope-dependent relation arises from a balance between particle fluxes that tend to loft a soil and gravitational settling of particles into available pore space. A specialized form of the Fokker-Planck equation adapted to such particle motions clarifies how the particle flux involves advective and diffusive parts. This in turn contributes to a kinematic description of the diffusion-like coefficient. Ingredients of this coefficient include an active soil thickness, a characteristic particle size, the porosity in excess of a consolidated porosity, and the rate of particle activation as a function of depth. These last two ingredients, vertical porosity structure and activation rate, in effect characterize the magnitude and frequency of settling particle motions related to biological activity and thereby set the rate constant of the transport process. The significance of land-surface slope is that it is a measure of the downslope component of slope-normal lofting that is balanced by settling. Because the diffusion-like coefficient contains the soil thickness, the analysis suggests that the soil flux is proportional to the "depth-slope" product. The analysis is consistent with published profiles of soil creep displacement and with published estimates of soil flux obtained by downslope integration of soil production rates for hillslopes in California and Australia.

However, much of the data arose from experiments in small diameter cylindrical vessels, where the results might have been influenced by the wall effect. Wall effect corrections developed by others were applied to 178 of the 480 data points collected. This corrected data set is believed to be free of the influence of wall effects. Existing drag and settling velocity correlations were compared to this data set. In addition, new correlations of the same forms were developed using the corrected data. Two new correlations of sphere terminal velocity are proposed, one applicable for all Reynolds numbers less than 2 × 105, and the other designed to predict settling velocities with exceptional accuracy for terminal Reynolds numbers less than 4,000, a region that contains almost all applications of interest in environmental engineering. The trial and error solution for settling velocity using the Fair and Geyer equation for drag should be retired in favor of the direct calculation available from these new correlations.},

This may appear to be a simple problem but in fact is one that displays a rich variety of different behaviors which allow us to understand better dissipative systems such as granular media. Studies performed previously have shown that the motion of the single ball on the rough surface can be characterized by three different dynamic regimes according to the different values of the two control parameters, the inclination angle $\theta$ and the ratio $\Phi$ = R/r, where R is the radius of the rolling ball and r the radius of the glass beads which make up the rough surface. The three regimes are a decelerated regime A, a stationary regime B, characterized by a constant average velocity and a jumping regime C. This result was found to be independent of the composition of the rolling ball and the rough surface. It has been demonstrated that regime B is characterized by a viscous-like friction force that appears for specific parameter values. This friction force can be explained by a model whose central ingredient is the geometry of the surface. The trajectory of the ball in regime B can be pictured as a driven random walk motion where the fluctuations of the local velocities are due to collisions of the moving sphere and the surface grains. A detailed analysis of diffusive properties of the motion is discussed. {\textcopyright} 1999 American Institute of Physics.},

This model, based upon classical impact dynamics and Hertzian theories, analytically relates the velocity change of the microsphere to the physical parameters of the microsphere and the surface and to the microsphere-surface adhesion forces. The model is based upon two fundamental assumptions, namely, that the energy losses due to the process of material deformation and the process of adhesion are independent and, that the energy loss due to the adhesion process occurs only during the rebound phase of the impact. No assumptions are made about the nature of inelastic deformations in the formulation of the model, permitting it to apply equally well to viscoelastic, elastic-plastic, or other materials or combinations thereof. The utility and accuracy of the model is assessed by comparing its predictions to experimental results. The model and the experimental data are used further to explore the relationship between the work done by the adhesion fracture force during rebound and the theoretical energy associated with the van der Waals adhesion force. The ability of the model to predict critical velocities is illustrated and discussed also. {\textcopyright} 1992 Elseiver Science Publishing Co., Inc.},

abstract = {A general approach is presented for solving the problem of the collision of two rigid bodies at a point. The approach overcomes the difficulties encountered by others on the treatment of contact velocity reversals and negative energy losses. A classical problem is solved; the initial velocities are presumed known and the final velocities unknown. The interaction process between the two bodies is modeled using two coefficients. These are the classical coefficient of restitution, e, and the ratio, $\mu$, of tangential to normal impulses. The latter quantity can be a coefficient of friction as a special case. The paper reveals that these coefficients have a much broader intepretation than previously recognized in the solution of collision problems. The appropriate choice of values for $\mu$ is related to the energy loss of the collision. It is shown that $\mu$ is bounded by values which correspond to no sliding at separation and conservation of energy. Another bound on $\mu$ combined with limits on the coefficient e, provides an overall bound on the energy loss of a collision. Examples from existing mechanics literature are solved to illustrate the significance of the coefficients and their relationship to the energy loss of collisions.},

In the absence of binary collisions, a particle which has a random initial velocity tends to a final state where the translational velocities are zero, and the rotational velocity is equal to (-2Vw/d), where Vw is the wall velocity. When the effect of binary collisions is included, it is found that there are two possible final steady states, depending on the values of the tangential and normal coefficients of restitution. For certain parameter values, the final steady state is a stationary state, where the translational velocities of all the particles reduce to zero. For other parameter values, the final steady state is dynamic state where the translational velocity fluctuations are non-zero. In the dynamic state, the mean-square velocity has a power-law scaling with $\epsilon$ in the limit $\epsilon$ → 0. The exponents predicted by the theory are found to be in quantitative agreement with simulation results in two dimensions. {\textcopyright} 2006 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {Flow refugia provide a mechanism that can explain the persistence of macroinvertebrate communities in flood-prone, gravel-bed rivers. The movement behaviour of macroinvertebrates is a key element of the flow refugia hypothesis, but surprisingly little is known about it. In particular, little is known about how local near-bed hydraulics and bed micro-topography affect macroinvertebrate movements. We used a novel casting technique to reproduce a natural gravel-bed substrate in a large flume where we were able to observe the movement behaviour of the cased caddisfly, Potamophylax latipennis at different discharges. The crawling paths and drift events of animals were analysed from video recordings and used to classify sites on the substrate according to the type of insect movement. We used acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) measurements close to the boundary to characterise hydraulic conditions at different sites and a detailed Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to characterise sites topographically. Animals made shorter more disjointed crawling journeys as discharge increased, although they tended to follow consistent paths across the substrate. As hypothesised, crawling behaviour was locally associated with low elevations, low flow velocities and low turbulent kinetic energies, while sites that insects avoided were characterised by higher elevations, velocities and turbulence. Discrimination was greater at higher discharges, indicating that movement behaviour is contingent upon flow conditions. We suppose that these relations reflect the need of animals to reduce the risk of entrainment and minimise energy expenditure by avoiding areas of high fluid drag. As discharge increased, there was a general upward shift in the frequency distributions of local velocities and turbulent kinetic energies. The animals responded to these shifts and it is clear that their different activities were not limited to fixed ranges of velocity and turbulence. We assume that the absolute hydraulic forces would become a limiting factor at some higher discharge. At the discharges examined here, which are below those required to instigate framework particle entrainment, patterns of animal movement appear to be associated with the animals' experiences of relative rather than absolute hydraulic forces. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The occurrence of sufficiently energetic flow events characterized by impulses of varying magnitude is treated as a point process. It is hypothesized that the rare but extreme magnitude impulses are responsible for the removal of coarse grains from the bed matrix. This conjecture is investigated utilizing distributions from extreme value theory and a series of incipient motion experiments. The application of extreme value distributions is demonstrated for both the entire sets of impulses and the maxima above a sufficiently high impulse quantile. In particular, the Frechet distribution is associated with a power law relationship between the frequency of occurrence and magnitude of impulses. It provides a good fit to the flow impulses, having comparable performance to other distributions. Next, a more accurate modeling of the tail of the distribution of impulses is pursued, consistent with the observation that the majority of impulses above a critical value are directly linked to grain entrainments. The peaks over threshold method is implemented to extract conditional impulses in excess of a sufficiently high impulse level. The generalized Pareto distribution is fitted to the excess impulses, and parameters are estimated for various impulse thresholds and methods of estimation for all the experimental runs. Finally, the episodic character of individual grain mobilization is viewed as a survival process, interlinked to the extremal character of occurrence of impulses. The interarrival time of particle entrainment events is successfully modeled by the Weibull and exponential distributions, which belong to the family of extreme value distributions.

In contrast, one-stage detectors that are applied over a regular, dense sampling of possible object locations have the potential to be faster and simpler, but have trailed the accuracy of two-stage detectors thus far. In this paper, we investigate why this is the case. We discover that the extreme foreground-background class imbalance encountered during training of dense detectors is the central cause. We propose to address this class imbalance by reshaping the standard cross entropy loss such that it down-weights the loss assigned to well-classified examples. Our novel Focal Loss focuses training on a sparse set of hard examples and prevents the vast number of easy negatives from overwhelming the detector during training. To evaluate the effectiveness of our loss, we design and train a simple dense detector we call RetinaNet. Our results show that when trained with the focal loss, RetinaNet is able to match the speed of previous one-stage detectors while surpassing the accuracy of all existing state-of-the-art two-stage detectors.

abstract = {This paper continues the investigation of the motion of solitary grains in a water stream, reported by Francis. The trajectories of solid grains are photographed by a multi-exposure technique as they are propelled by water streams along the bed of a laboratory channel. Many thousands of photographs were taken and analysed to determine the positions, velocities and accelerations of the grain. The technique does not take into account the possible effect, in multi-grain transport, of intergranular collisions. The three different modes of transport of grains were all observed - rolling, saltation and suspension, and the proportion of each found for a variety of transport stage. The development of suspension is much less rapid than the development of saltation from rolling, but even at the highest stage used, about 3.0, there is still a small amount of rolling. The trajectory dimensions and geometry are shown in relation to the stage which uniquely determines the geometry. Experiments where the grain is suddenly entrained from a stationary position show that several features of the subsequent trajectory are the same as those of a trajectory with a prior history of movement: thus it is inferred that the start of a trajectory is by way of hydrodynamic forces rather than by the conservation of momentum of previous trajectories. Impacts and trajectories were analysed for the coefficient of friction tan GAMMAa and for the height of the effective thrust. While tan GAMMAa is shown to be rather larger than has been suspected in the p ast, the variation of ySUPn throws light upon predominance of slow fluid near the bed rather than high speed inrushes of fast fluid.

These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest-neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low-residual least-squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially-occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds.},

abstract = {A high-speed video system was used to study the interaction between sediment particles and turbulence in the wall region of an open channel flow with both smooth and transitionally rough beds. In smooth flows, particles immersed within the viscous sublayer were seen to accumulate along low-speed wall streaks; apparently due to the presence of quasi-streamwise vortices in the wall region. Larger particles did not tend to group along streaks, however their velocity was observed to respond to the streaky structure of the flow velocity in the wall region. In transitionally rough flows particle sorting was not observed. Coherent flow structures in the form of shear layers typically observed in the near-wall region interacted with sediment particles lying on the channel bottom, resulting in the particles being entrained into suspension. Although there has been some speculation that this process would not be effective in entraining particles totally immersed in the viscous sublayer, the results obtained demonstrate the opposite. The entrainment mechanism appears to be the same independent of the roughness condition of the bottom wall, smooth or transitionally rough. In the latter case, however, hiding effects tend to preclude the entrainment of particles with sizes finer than that of the roughness elements. The analysis of particle velocity during entrainment shows that the streamwise component tends to be much smaller than the local mean flow velocity, while the vertical component tends to be much larger than the local standard deviation of the vertical flow velocity fluctuations, which would indicate that such particles are responding to rather extreme flow ejection events.},

abstract = {Bedload and river morphology interact in a strong feedback manner. Bedload conditions the development of river morphology along different space and time scales; however, by concentrating the flow in preferential paths, a given morphology controls bedload for a given discharge. As bedload is a non-linear response of shear stress, local morphology is likely to have a strong impact on bedload prediction when the shear stress is averaged over the section, as is usually done. This was investigated by comparing bedload measured in different bed morphologies (step-pool, plane bed, riffle-pool, braiding, and sand beds), with bedload measured in narrow flumes in the absence of any bed form, used here as a reference. The initial methodology consisted of fitting a bedload equation to the flume data. Secondly, the morphological signature of each river was studied as the distance to this referent equation. It was concluded that each morphology affects bedload in a different way. For a given average grain shear stress, the larger the river, the larger the deviation from the flume transport. Narrow streams are those morphologies that behave more like flumes; this is particularly true with flat beds, whereas results deviate from flumes to a greater extent in step-pools. The riffle-pool's morphology impacts bedload at different levels depending on the degree of bar development, considered here through the ratio D84/D50 which is used as a proxy for the local bed patchiness and morphology. In braiding rivers morphological effects are important but difficult to assess because width is dependent on transport rate. Bed morphology was found to have negligible effects in sand bed rivers where the Shields stress is usually sufficiently high to minimize the non-linearity effects when hydraulics is averaged over the section.},

The scaled data are fitted with a nonlinear function. Clasts larger than the median of surface material exhibit a steep decline of mobility, with an upper limit for mobility near Di/D50sub = 10. Smaller materials exhibit a less sensitive relation. We suppose that trapping of small clasts affects their travel distance.

The suspended load transport rates of individual fractions were measured and compared with both Einstein's and Holtroff's methods of calculation of suspended load for individual fractions. These methods were found to be unsatisfactory in the present range of sediment parameters. A relationship is found to exist between the dimensionless shear stress and the suspended transport rate for uniform sediment. To make this relation applicable to nonuniform sediments, a corrective multiplying factor for shear stress is introduced. The dimensionless parameters which govern this correction factor are identified and a relation for the same obtained. In this manner the relation can be applied to individual size portions of a sediment mixture. {\textcopyright} ASCE.},

@article{Haff1983,
abstract = {The behaviour of granular material in motion is studied from a continuum point of view. Insofar as possible, individual grains are treated as the ‘molecules' of a granular ‘fluid'. Besides the obvious contrast in shape, size and mass, a key difference between true molecules and grains is that collisions of the latter are inevitably inelastic. This, together with the fact that the fluctuation velocity may be comparable to the flow velocity, necessitates explicit incorporation of the energy equation, in addition to the continuity and momentum equations, into the theoretical description. Simple ‘microscopic' kinetic models are invoked for deriving expressions for the ‘coefficients' of viscosity, thermal diffusivity and energy absorption due to collisions. The ‘coefficients' are not constants, but are functions of the local state of the medium, and therefore depend on the local ‘temperature' and density. In general the resulting equations are nonlinear and coupled. However, in the limits ≪d, wheres is the mean separation between neighbouring grain surfaces and is a grain diameter, the above equations become linear and can be solved analytically. An important dependent variable, in this formulation, in addition to the flow velocity u, is the mean random fluctuation ('thermal') velocity v of an individual grain. With a sufficient flux of energy supplied to the system through the boundaries of the container, v can remain non zero even in the absence of flow. The existence of a non uniform v is the means by which energy can be ‘conducted' from one part of the system to another. Because grain collisions are inelastic, there is a natural (damping) lengthscale, governed by the value of d, which strongly influences the functional dependence of v on position. Several illustrative examples of static (u = 0) systems are solved. As an example of grain flow, various Couette type problems are solved analytically. The pressure, shear stress, and ‘thermal' velocity function v are all determined by the relative plate velocity U (and the boundary conditions). If v is set equal to zero at both plates, the pressure and stress are both proportional to U2i.e. the fluid is non-Newtonian. However, if sufficient energy is supplied externally through the walls (v ≠ 0 there), then the forces become proportional to the first power of U. Some examples of Couette flow are given which emphasize the large effect on the grain system properties of even a tiny amount of inelasticity in grain—grain collisions. From these calculations it is suggested that, for the case of Couette flow, the flow of sand is supersonic over most of the region between the confining plates. {\textcopyright} 1983, Cambridge University Press.

The method is similar in principle to the time-integration method used for measuring the discharge of liquids. The mean velocity of the sand particles can be deduced directly from the measurements. The volume rate of transport can be inferred either by an independent measurement of the thickness of movement of the bed ripples, or by mixing the active sand uniformly with a strip of the bed at the start and measuring the loss of active sand during the experiment. An adequate length must be left between the point of injection and the section at which the passage of tracer is measured. This length depends on the hop lengths of the particles and not on the frequency with which hops are performed.},

abstract = {The construction of ski-pistes can cause serious damage to all the components of an ecosystem and may therefore be considered as one of the main causes of human-driven environmental changes in mountain habitats. This study was aimed at assessing the responses of different ground dwelling arthropod assemblages (i.e. ground beetles, spiders and grasshoppers) to ski-piste restoration through hydroseeding with commercial seed mixtures. The soil, vegetation and arthropods of restored and un-restored ski-pistes and the adjacent grassland have been sampled at two high altitude sites in the north-western Italian Alps. The ski-piste soil was characterized by a higher skeletal content and, consequently, a lower amount of fine earth and organic matter than that of the undisturbed adjacent grassland. The plant cover of the restored ski-pistes was very low above 2,500 m a.s.l.; the vegetation cover below this threshold was higher in the study area, mainly due to the seeded species. The unrestored ski-pistes showed very large proportions of bare ground. The responses of the three ground-dwelling arthropod groups to vegetation conditions were different. GLMMs and IndVal analyses showed that all three groups avoided the unrestored ski-pistes plots, which were characterized by a very scarce vegetation cover, irrespective of the altitude. The low altitude plots of the restored ski-pistes, which were characterized by a high vegetation cover, had a significantly larger number of grasshoppers on the ski-pistes than on the adjacent grassland plots. Moreover, these restored ski-piste plots were used in equal proportion to the adjacent grassland plots by ground beetles but avoided by spiders. When ski-pistes become sufficiently revegetated by hydroseeded plants, they are colonized by grasshoppers and, to a lesser extent, by ground-beetles. Spiders, instead, do not colonize the pistes, thus demonstrating that they are the most sensitive arthropods and may therefore represent the best indicators of human-driven environmental changes in high altitude alpine habitats. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Can we recover a signal f ∈ ℝ                         N. from a small number of linear measurements? A series of recent papers developed a collection of results showing that it is surprisingly possible to reconstruct certain types of signals accurately from limited measurements. In a nutshell, suppose that f is compressible in the sense that it is well-approximated by a linear combination of M vectors taken from a known basis $\Psi$. Then not knowing anything in advance about the signal, f can (very nearly) be recovered from about M log N generic nonadaptive measurements only. The recovery procedure is concrete and consists in solving a simple convex optimization program. In this paper, we show that these ideas are of practical significance. Inspired by theoretical developments, we propose a series of practical recovery procedures and test them on a series of signals and images which are known to be well approximated in wavelet bases. We demonstrate that it is empirically possible to recover an object from about 3M-5M projections onto generically chosen vectors with an accuracy which is as good as that obtained by the ideal M-term wavelet approximation. We briefly discuss possible implications in the areas of data compression and medical imaging. {\textcopyright} 2005 SPIE and IS{\&}T.},

@article{Hassan1990,
abstract = {Clifford et al. (1992) argue that differences in hydraulic conditions at the moment of sediment entrainment in Turkey Brook, flood by flood, are attributable to variations in the form drag that arises from cluster microforms. While not denying the possibility of variable cluster concentration, we show that the time‐dependent bed consolidation and cementation that arises as a function of interstitial matrix development can also account for variation in the traction threshold. Clifford et al. further postulate that the growth of pebble clusters just prior to bedload entrainment is a cause of the observed differences in traction thresholds at the start and finish of bedload during a flood event. This merits further examination. However, we point out that clusters are not only observed at low flow and, therefore, already present and able to contribute significant form drag as the next bedload generating flood waxes, but that they are known both to survive more or less intact and to entrap mobile particles during bed disturbing events. The revelation by Clifford et al. that flow structure in the River Quarme reflects differences in bed rugosity between riffles and pools and that it relates in scale to bed roughness elements (perhaps clusters) is not surprising. There is, however, some difficulty in distinguishing the precedence of chicken and egg when using this data set to elucidate the cause of cluster spacing. Nevertheless, the inference that flow and form are dynamically linked is in sympathy with our own conclusions that cluster spacing is an equilibrium condition governed by the interplay of flow resistance and sediment transport.

Specifically, we find the steady-state probability distribution of the population density in the framework of well-known Verhulst equation with fluctuating population mortality in the form of Poisson sequence with unipolar pulses, leading to an abrupt decrease in population density at random times. As shown, the most probable value of the population density tends to zero with increasing the mean rate of pulses, that is, to an extinction of biological population in perspective. Further, we consider the stochastic Hongler equation which can serve as an approximate model of genetic selection. In the case of multiplicative white Poisson noise having bipolar exponentially distributed amplitudes of pulses we observe noise-induced transition to bimodality (through the trimodal phase) in the steady-state probability distribution with an increase in the mean frequency of pulses. We also discovered a new phenomenon, namely, a direct transition from unimodality to trimodality with a change in the noise intensity, which could not be detected in the framework of the Gaussian perturbation.

Exact analytical expressions are found for the survival probability of the particle as a function of time. The survival probability has a multiexponential decay, and to characterize it, we use the average rate constant k, as well as the instantaneous rate r(t). Our approach can easily be extended to the case where the diffusion coefficient takes n different values. The model should be of interest to biological processes, in which a reactant searches for a target in a heterogeneous environment, making the diffusion coefficient a random function of time. The best example for this is a protein searching for a target site on the DNA.},

abstract = {Spatially periodic structures are exposed to additive Poissonian white shot noise of zero average. Because the underlying master equation no longer obeys the principle of detailed balance, these non-equilibrium fluctuations induce a macroscopic current—even in the absence of spatial asymmetry. The resulting current can be expressed in analytical closed form and we discuss its behaviour in the limits of very weak and very strong noise intensities. We find that the current increases monotonically and—in contrast to common intuition—saturates at infinitely strong noise intensity. The role of internal symmetries of the periodic structure is investigated from the viewpoint of optimizing the current amplitude at fixed noise intensity. {\textcopyright} 1995 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

We study in detail the class of time-instantaneous Langevin equations and the important class of retarded (Mori-type) Langevin equations with both, Gaussian and general colored random forces. Using the generalization of the nonlinear Langevin equation for continuous Markov processes with white Gaussian noise and white generalized Poisson noise we show that the resulting masterequation can be recast in the Kramers-Moyal form. Interpreting this Langevin equation in the Stratonovitch sense we deduce the fluctuation induced drift (spurious drift) which can be divided up into two parts, the well known part induced by white Gaussian noise and the one induced by white generalized Poisson noise.},

abstract = {Generalized Langevin equations (GLE) with multiplicative white Poisson noise pose the usual prescription dilemma leading to different evolution equations (master equations) for the probability distribution. Contrary to the case of multiplicative Gaussian white noise, the Stratonovich prescription does not correspond to the well-known midpoint (or any other intermediate) prescription. By introducing an inertial term in the GLE, we show that the It{\^{o}} and Stratonovich prescriptions naturally arise depending on two time scales, one induced by the inertial term and the other determined by the jump event. We also show that, when the multiplicative noise is linear in the random variable, one prescription can be made equivalent to the other by a suitable transformation in the jump probability distribution. We apply these results to a recently proposed stochastic model describing the dynamics of primary soil salinization, in which the salt mass balance within the soil root zone requires the analysis of different prescriptions arising from the resulting stochastic differential equation forced by multiplicative white Poisson noise, the features of which are tailored to the characters of the daily precipitation. A method is finally suggested to infer the most appropriate prescription from the data. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Physical Society.},

For exponentially distributed inputs, we present a class of transient solutions, as well as a generic steady-state solution in terms of a potential function and the Pope-Ching formula. These results allow us to describe state-dependent jumps in a double-well potential for steady-state particle dynamics, as well as transient salinity dynamics forced by state-dependent jumps. Both examples showcase a stochastic description that is more general than the limiting case of Brownian motion to which the jump process defaults in the limit of infinitely frequent and small jumps. Accordingly, our analysis may be used to explore a continuum of stochastic behavior from infrequent, large jumps to frequent, small jumps approaching a diffusion process.},

abstract = {We study the search kinetics of an immobile target by a concentration of randomly moving searchers. The object of the study is to optimize the probability of detection within the constraints of our model. The target is hidden on a one-dimensional lattice in the sense that searchers have no a priori information about where it is, and may detect it only upon encounter. The searchers perform random walks in discrete time n ≤ 0,1,2,...,N, where N is the maximal time the search process is allowed to run. With probability $\alpha$ the searchers step on a nearest-neighbour, and with probability (1-$\alpha$) they leave the lattice and stay off until they land back on the lattice at a fixed distance L away from the departure point. The random walk is thus intermittent. We calculate the probability PN that the target remains undetected up to the maximal search time N, and seek to minimize this probability. We find that PN is a non-monotonic function of $\alpha$, and show that there is an optimal choice $\alpha$opt(N) of $\alpha$ well within the intermittent regime, 0{\textless}$\alpha$opt(N){\textless}1, whereby PN can be orders of magnitude smaller compared to the 'pure' random walk cases $\alpha$ ≤ 0 and $\alpha$ ≤ 1. {\textcopyright} IOP Publishing Ltd.},

This review focuses on fluvial patterns, both free and forced. Free patterns arise spontaneously from instabilities of the liquid-solid interface in the form of interfacial waves affecting either bed elevation or channel alignment: Their peculiar feature is that they express instabilities of the boundary itself rather than flow instabilities capable of destabilizing the boundary. Forced patterns arise from external hydrologic forcing affecting the boundary conditions of the system. After reviewing the formulation of the problem of morphodynamics, which turns out to have the nature of a free boundary problem, I discuss systematically the hierarchy of patterns observed in river basins at different scales.

abstract = {Eight flume experiments were conducted to study the development of bed surface texture and structure in the presence of partial bed material transport. The experiments have two phases, a no-feed degradational phase followed by a feeding phase. A surface structure of irregular, reticulate stone nets and clusters was developed before sediment feeding commenced. Bed load transport equaled or slightly exceeded the fed supply, except at the highest feed rate. The bed structure was maintained, but bed surface texture fined with increasing sediment load. The two phenomena may coexist because the largest grains on the bed moved only very sporadically. The actual sediment transport rates were much less than the expected rate calculated from the ratio of bed surface grain size to transported grain size. The difference reflects the increase in bed stability introduced by the bed structure. Between 17{\%} and 47{\%} of the bed shear stress is estimated to be carried by the structure, {\textless}4{\%} being absorbed by the load, while the bed grains carried the balance of the stress. Bed material transport is exceedingly sensitive to bed surface structure and grain size, which raises concerns about the realizable precision of grain size measurements and characterization of the structure.},

abstract = {A new basal sauropodomorph dinosaur, Arcusaurus pereirabdalorum, sp. nov., is named and described on the basis of a partial, disarticulated but associated skull and dispersed cranial and postcranial elements from at least two individuals. Arcusaurus is part of a distinctive local fauna from the upper Elliot Formation (Lower Jurassic) in the Senekal District, Free State, South Africa. It can be diagnosed by various details of the premaxilla, nasal, and dentary in the skull and the shape of the distal caudal vertebrae. The taxon displays an unusual mix of characteristics. It lacks several synapomorphies of Plateosauria (Plateosaurus + Massospondylus and all descendants of their most recent common ancestor) but does display other derived characteristics that are otherwise known only from less inclusive clades within Plateosauria. In a cladistic analysis a position outside Plateosauria as the sister group of the clade of Efraasia + more-derived sauropodomorphs is supported; however, this position was not found to be a significantly better explanation of the data as a relatively derived position within Plateosauria. If the basal position for Arcusaurus is accepted, then a divergence from other sauropodomorphs in the middle Norian and a ghost lineage up to 35 Ma is implied. No other non-plateosaurian sauropodomorphs are known from the Jurassic, making Arcusaurus a potentially relictual taxon in the Early Jurassic. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Particles projecting from the bed of an alluvial channel distort the fluid stream to produce a distinctive pressure field. This has considerable significance for both the entrapment and entrainment of other particles and is a primary cause of the widespread occurrence of pebble clusters and boulder shadows. Lift and drag forces are determined on clustered hemispherical particles of varying size. In the wake of an obstructing particle both forces are shown to vary directly with particle separation in a linear fashion. On the stoss side of the cluster, drag is uniform regardless of the separation of the component particles, but lift is shown to increase when particle separation is small, so affecting stability. This mutual interference of neighbouring clustered bed particles is a vital consideration of incipient motion and is shown by field evidence to cause a wide range in transport stage for particles of similar size and shape. On average, 46{\%} of clustered particles are entrained by flood flow compared to 87{\%} of particles in open plane‐beds. The influence of clusters is a major determinant of sedimentary sorting.

Clustering is quantified by using a novel normalization of Ripley's K statistic designed for use in power law functions. At 95{\%} confidence, many but not all beds stabilized with coarse grains becoming more clustered than complete spatial randomness. The clustering statistic predicts hydraulic roughness better than D84 does (the diameter at which 84{\%} of grains are smaller), suggesting that the spatial organization of the bed can be a stronger control than grain size on flow hydraulics. Initial conditions affect the degree of clustering at stability, indicating sensitivity to history.},

abstract = {Field observations, experiments, and numerical simulations suggest that pool-riffles along gravel bed mountain streams develop due to downstream variations of channel width. Where channels narrow, pools are observed, and at locations of widening, riffles occur. Based on previous work, we hypothesize that the bed profile is coupled to downstream width variations through momentum fluxes imparted to the channel surface, which scale with downstream changes of flow velocity. We address this hypothesis with flume experiments understood through scaling theory. Our experiments produce pool-riffle like structures across average Shields stresses $\tau$∗ that are a factor 1.5–2 above the threshold mobility condition of the experimental grain size distribution. Local topographic responses are coupled to channel width changes, which drive flows to accelerate or decelerate on average, for narrowing and widening, respectively. We develop theory which explains the topography-width-velocity coupling as a ratio of two reinforcing timescales. The first timescale captures the time necessary to do work to the channel bed. The second timescale characterizes the relative time magnitude of momentum transfer from the flowing fluid to the channel bed surface. Riffle-like structures develop where the work and momentum timescales are relatively large, and pools form where the two timescales are relatively small. We show that this result helps to explain local channel bed slopes along pool-riffles for five data sets representing experimental, numerical, and natural cases, which span 2 orders of magnitude of reach-averaged slope. Additional model testing is warranted.},

The first photogrammetric methods were developed in the middle of the 19th century by Laussedat and Meydenbauer for mapping purposes and reconstruction of buildings (Luhmann, 2003). These photogrammetricmethods were based on geometric modelling of the image formation process, exploiting the perspective projection of a three-dimensional scene into a two-dimensional image plane. Image formation by perspective projection corresponds to the pinhole camera model. There are different image formation models, describing optical devices such as fisheye lenses or omnidirectional lenses. In this work, however, we will restrict ourselves to the pinhole model since it represents the most common image acquisition devices.},

abstract = {A successful stream restoration design must be able to transport the sediment supplied to it with the available flow. Although this guidance is widely cited, only water supply is routinely incorporated in a consistent manner in restoration design. A number of factors can alter both the caliber and rate of sediment supply to a stream. Exact forecasts of sediment supply are seldom available and it is often possible to reliably estimate only the sign of changes in sediment supply. Channel design methodology, including estimates of sediment transport, must account for large uncertainty in future sediment supply. This paper examines sediment transport in coarse-bedded streams with the goal of identifying robust methods that provide reliable estimates of present and future transport. The response of bed composition and elevation to changes in sediment supply rate and caliber is examined. The accuracy and cost of methods for estimating sediment flux are evaluated. Emphasis is placed on determining the transport of different grain sizes, including the number of size fractions needed to adequately address potential channel change.},

abstract = {A ID finite-volume model has been established to simulate the nonequilibrium transport of nonuniform sediment with transient flows, such as dam-break flow and overtopping flow, over movable beds. The effects of sediment transport and bed change on the flow are considered in the flow continuity and momentum equations. An explicit algorithm is adopted to solve the governing equations. The model has been tested preliminarily in several experimental cases, including an experiment on wedge development due to sediment overloading under transcritical flow conditions, an experiment on dam surface erosion due to overtopping flow, and two experiments on dam-break flow over movable beds. The model performs quite well in the cases of wedge development and overtopping flow, but significantly under-predicts the bed erosion due to dam-break flow. A modification has thus been made by considering the effects of sediment concentration on sediment settling and entrainment in the case of dam-break flow over movable beds. The present model has been compared with the traditional movable-bed "clear-water" model that ignores the effects of sediment on the flow. It has been found that the present model provides more reasonable predictions, and the "clear-water" model has larger errors when sediment transport is stronger and may even fail in the case of dam-break flow. {\textcopyright} 2008 International Association of Hydraulic Engineering and Research.},

abstract = {Estimates of sediment transport rates in gravel-bed rivers are typically developed from formulae or from a sampling campaign. The former are notoriously inaccurate; the latter require a large effort and may still not achieve acceptable accuracy. A wide range of geomorphological problems, particularly those at the watershed scale, could be addressed more accurately if reliable local estimates of transport rate could be incorporated routinely into such studies. This requires a method for estimating transport rate with acceptable accuracy and a minimum of effort. A consistent approach to estimating transport is not just a matter of which formula or sampler to use; a suitable approach requires a consistent and reliable scaling of the water discharge and an integral description of the sediment that is both meaningful and practical. An approach proposed here, using a few observations of small transport rates to calibrate a transport formula, is likely to provide a superior combination of accuracy and effort and substantially reduces flow-scaling error. Small transport rates can be measured effectively using pit samplers, which allow the sampling periods needed for accurate measurements. Grain size can be represented as two fractions, sand and gravel, which capture some of the important transport dynamics and effectively represent important environmental problems within a tractable methodological approach. The approach is nearly independent of the uncertainty associated with measuring slope and bed grain-size in the field. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2001 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {A sediment particle traversing the fluvial system may spend the majority of the total transit time at rest, stored in various sedimentary deposits. Floodplains are among the most important of these deposits, with the potential to store large amounts of sediment for long periods of time. The virtual velocity of a sediment grain depends strongly on the amount of time spent in storage, but little is known about sediment storage times. Measurements of floodplain vegetation age have suggested that storage times are exponentially distributed, a case that arises when all the sediment on a floodplain is equally vulnerable to erosion in a given interval. This assumption has been incorporated into sediment routing models, despite some evidence that younger sediment is more likely to be eroded from floodplains than older sediment. We investigate the relationship between sediment age and erosion, which we term the "erosion hazard," with a model of a meandering river that constructs its floodplain by lateral accretion. We find that the erosion hazard decreases with sediment age, leading to a storage time distribution that is not exponential. We propose an alternate model that requires that channel motion is approximately diffusive and results in a heavy tailed distribution of storage time. The model applies to timescales over which the direction of channel motion is uncorrelated. We speculate that the lower end of this range of time is set by themeander cutoff timescale and the upper end is set by processes that limit the width of the meander belt. {\textcopyright}2013.

The mobile bed data featured generalised sediment transport for all size fractions smaller than the d 90 . The fixed bed was obtained as result of an armouring process. Comparison of these data sets reveals differences on such parameters of the bursting cycle as the maximum shear stress and the transported momentum. These results point to a reorganization of turbulence, in the near-bed region, when the bed is mobile.

abstract = {The St Venant equations in conjunction with a phenomenological law for erosion are used to explore the nonlinear dynamics of cyclic steps - linearly unstable bedform patterns which emerge when uniform flow over an erodible bed becomes supercritical. The instability saturates by blocking the overlying flow and creating hydraulic jumps just downstream of the steepest part of the steps. Near onset, steadily migrating, nonlinear step patterns are constructed and shown to suffer a short-wavelength secondary instability that 'roughens' the bed and renders the staircase patterns less regular and time-dependent. An eddy viscosity is needed to regularize both the onset of the primary steps and the secondary instabilities. Further beyond the critical Froude number, the steps block the flow sufficiently to arrest erosion significantly, creating complicated patterns mixing migrating steps and stationary bedforms. The reduction in flux also stabilizes roll waves - a second, hydrodynamic instability of uniform supercritical flow. It is further shown that roll waves are purely convective instabilities, whereas cyclic steps can be absolute. Thus, in the finite geometries of the laboratory or field, it may be difficult to excite roll waves. On the other hand, the complicated spatiotemporal patterns associated with the cyclic-step instability should develop naturally. The complicated patterns resulting from the secondary instability do not appear to have been observed experimentally, calling into question the validity of the model. {\textcopyright} Cambridge University Press 2012.},

The ability to test these formulae across numerous field sites has, until recently, been hampered by a paucity of bed load transport data for gravel bed rivers. We use 2104 bed load transport observations in 24 gravel bed rivers in Idaho to assess the performance of eight different formulations of four bed load transport equations. Results show substantial differences in performance but no consistent relationship between formula performance and degree of calibration or complexity. However, formulae containing a transport threshold typically exhibit poor performance. Furthermore, we find that the transport data are best described by a simple power function of discharge. From this we propose a new bed load transport equation and identify channel and watershed characteristics that control the exponent and coefficient of the proposed power function. We find that the exponent is principally a factor of supply-related channel armoring (transport capacity in excess of sediment supply), whereas the coefficient is related to drainage area (a surrogate for absolute sediment supply). We evaluate the accuracy of the proposed power function at 17 independent test sites.},

abstract = {Virtual process engineering (VPE) aims to redefine the roadmap for process scaling-up and optimization, from stepwise experiments to high-performance computer simulations. This is a long-cherished dream of chemical engineers, but requires high standards of Accuracy (the agreement between the simulation and the real process), Capability (the computational speed, scale, and resolution of the simulation), and Efficiency (cost-effective and easy to use), in short, ACE. For complex processes such as gas–solid fluidization, the gap between state-of-the-art simulations and VPE is still huge in terms of ACE. However, the work reported in this paper narrows this gap significantly. In this study, a coarse-grained discrete particle method (DPM) defined by the energy-minimization multi-scale (EMMS) model is deployed for high-resolution simulations of fluidized beds, with the gas- and solid-phase equations solved concurrently by CPUs and GPUs in a heterogeneous supercomputing system. With systematic optimization of the model, numerical method, software, and hardware, we are able to simulate lab- to pilot-scale fluidized beds at quasi-realtime speed, and conduct virtual experiments on such systems. This enables very-long-time simulations to obtain important engineering parameters such as the particle residence time distribution, attrition and deactivation indexes. This work demonstrates that the industrial application of VPE is almost on the horizon.},

These impacts can vary greatly depending on the hydro- geomorphic setting of the river, and on the change in water and sediment supply to the reach downstream. Results drawn from field studies of gravel-bed reaches of the Colorado River in Colorado and Trinity River in California illustrate the range of issues to consider in assessing the effects of flow regime and sediment transport on micro- and meso-scale habitats. Important aspects of bed-load trans- port at the local scale are discussed, along with ecological implications of spe- cific transport phases and processes. For a wide range of rivers, including those that carry predominantly fine sediment (silt and sand), the loss of channel com- plexity and habitat heterogeneity represents a broader issue. We suggest that unless the broader-scale importance of sediment input and output is recognized and quantified, restoration efforts that focus on site-specific issues or single- species enhancement are likely to fall short of their objectives.},

The model describes the bed-load transport as dynamically interdependent motions of individual sediment particles under the flow action. A steady logarithmic velocity distribution over the flow depth is considered to represent fluid motion, while turbulent intensities are also included within the closure model. The present model accounts for both fluid-particle and particle-particle interactions, which are the predominant micro-mechanisms of bed-load transport under low and high tractive forces, respectively. Characteristic features of bed-load transport, previously reported by experimental observations, are numerically reproduced. The concept of vertical momentum transfer is exploited to describe features of concurrently present of saltation and sheet-flow layers. It is concluded that the vertical motion of particles is not significantly active in sheet-flow layer and the particle momentum is preserved. Consequently the interparticle collisions is the predominant mechanism of bed-load transport at high fluid tractive forces. {\textcopyright} 2009 International Association of Hydraulic Engineering and Research.},

abstract = {Heterogeneous materials abound in nature and man-made situations. Examples include porous media, biological materials, and composite materials. Diverse and interesting properties exhibited by these materials result from their complex microstructures, which also make it difficult to model the materials. Yeong and Torquato introduced a stochastic optimization technique that enables one to generate realizations of heterogeneous materials from a prescribed set of correlation functions. In this first part of a series of two papers, we collect the known necessary conditions on the standard two-point correlation function S2 (r) and formulate a conjecture. In particular, we argue that given a complete two-point correlation function space, S2 (r) of any statistically homogeneous material can be expressed through a map on a selected set of bases of the function space. We provide examples of realizable two-point correlation functions and suggest a set of analytical basis functions. We also discuss an exact mathematical formulation of the (re)construction problem and prove that S2 (r) cannot completely specify a two-phase heterogeneous material alone. Moreover, we devise an efficient and isotropy-preserving construction algorithm, namely, the lattice-point algorithm to generate realizations of materials from their two-point correlation functions based on the Yeong-Torquato technique. Subsequent analysis can be performed on the generated images to obtain desired macroscopic properties. These developments are integrated here into a general scheme that enables one to model and categorize heterogeneous materials via two-point correlation functions. We will mainly focus on basic principles in this paper. The algorithmic details and applications of the general scheme are given in the second part of this series of two papers. {\textcopyright} 2007 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {In this work we incorporate the effect of near-bed coherent flow structures into the entrainment of randomly configured mixed-size sediments. The fourth-order Gram-Charlier type probability density function (GC pdf) of near-bed streamwise velocity is employed to account for the higher-order correlations associated with turbulent bursting. A compilation of the published data over a wide range of bed roughness is used to analyze the near-bed coherent flow structures, including the second-, third-, and fourth-order moments of velocity fluctuation (i.e., turbulence intensity, skewness, and flatness factors) required in the fourth-order GC pdf. An important result of this study is a set of quantitative relations used to predict these higher-order moments as a function of the roughness Reynolds number. The random grain protrusion is parameterized with the exposure and friction heights, and an existing probabilistic approach is used to correct the hiding effect of mixed-size sediment. The above factors are all incorporated into the formulation of entrainment (rolling and lifting) probabilities. As compared to the previous normal and lognormal models, the present results demonstrate significantly improved agreement with the observed data for the unisize and mixed-size sediments under partial- and full-transport conditions. The results also reveal that the third-order GC pdf can be used to approximate the fourth-order one for the fully rough beds, however, for smooth beds the fourth-order GC pdf should be used to adequately incorporate the effects of higher-order correlations. This paper offers some new insights into the processes of sediment entrainment. {\textcopyright} ASCE.},

@article{Einstein1942,
abstract = {This paper introduces new formulas for the transportation of bed load that disputes Einstein's use of his time factor, tE, in calculating transport rate. His tE accounts for the falling velocity in still water of a given material, yet he applies this same tE in the context of a transport-rate problem. The authors introduce a new way of analyzing an old problem that everyone assumes needs no further development and as a result, respectfully disagree with Einstein's use of tE within a transport-rate problem. This research presents an original formula that introduces a new time factor, tZ, to be included instead. The major difference between tE and tZ is moving vf from the denominator to the numerator. The logic behind this is that the magnitude of a dense particle's falling velocity is larger and, therefore, tE should be shorter in time. However, in the context of a transport-rate problem, it should take longer for a dense particle to be transported to its destination; thus, the introduction of tZ resulting in a longer time. With the new expression for the time factor, tZ, as the settling velocity of bed-load material particles in still clear water divided by the constant of gravitational acceleration, Einstein's bed-load transportation formula is then modified accordingly as the variables in the formula are redefined. Experimental data used by Einstein are reanalyzed, and the data clearly show that separate formulas for different specific gravity bed-load materials are needed. The modified formula for gravel grains is verified by Smart's test data in steep channel (region of high intensity of transport) as is seen from the predicted curve running near the data points. When the bed-load transportation formulas in silty water and in differential temperature water are derived, the parameter related to the characteristics of the carrying medium is replaced accordingly. In both cases, the rate of bed-load transportation is found to be inversely proportional to the settling velocity of bed-load particles in the carrying medium. As the bed-load study involves three factors, namely, (1) characteristics of flow; (2) specific gravity of bed-load materials; and (3) characteristics of carrying medium, it can be seen that the formula derived considers these three factors in the formula modification. As Einstein is the only author in the field who brings the settling velocity of bed-load particles into the bed-load transportation study, this paper further addresses the importance of settling velocity and its role.},

abstract = {Bedload transport is known to be a highly fluctuating temporal phenomenon, even under constant (mean) flow conditions, as a consequence of stochasticity, bedform migration, grain sorting, hysteresis, or sediment supply limitation. Because bedload transport formulas usually refer to a single mean transport value for a given flow condition, one can expect that prediction accuracy (when compared to measurements) will depend on the amplitude and duration of fluctuations, which in turn depend on the time scale used for observations. This paper aims to identify how the time scale considered can affect bedload prediction. This was done by testing 16 common bedload transport formulas with four data sets corresponding to different measurement period durations: (i) highly fluctuating (quasi-)instantaneous field measurements; (ii) volumes accumulated at the event scale on two small alpine gravel-bed rivers, potentially affected by seasonal fluctuations; (iii) volumes accumulated at the interannual scale in a meandering gravel bed river, thought to be weakly subject to fluctuations; (iv) time-integrated flume measurements with nearly uniform sediments. The tests confirmed that the longer the measurement period, the better the precision of the formula's prediction interval. They also demonstrate several consequential limitations. Most threshold formulas are no longer valid when the flow condition is below two times the threshold condition for the largest elements' motion on the bed surface (considering D84). In such conditions, equations either predict zero transport, or largely overestimate the real transport, especially when D84 is high. There is a need for new sediment data collected with highly reliable techniques such as recording slot bedload samplers to further investigate this topic. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

The grain velocity equation agrees well with all experimentally determined velocities of single grains moving over fixed rough beds if a is allowed to vary with bed roughness and saltation height. Values of U*c for such overriding grains are substantially less than normally accepted values. The sediment transport rate equation predicts plane bed experimental data well, over five orders of magnitude of ib.

abstract = {The role played by the texture of the sediment supply on channel bed adjustments in gravel-bed rivers is poorly understood. To address this issue, an experimental campaign has been designed. Flume experiments lasting 96 h in a 9 m long, 0.60 m wide have been performed with different sand-gravel mixtures as feed textures. The response of the surface texture has been found to be highly dependent on the grain size distribution of the feed. When the feed texture included gravel, the finest fractions of the sediment supply infiltrate beneath the surface. Conversely, sand remains on the surface when the feed texture lacks gravel. This different textural response becomes obscured when water discharge increases. Further, the sediment transport rate approaches the feed rate differently depending on the content of gravel in the feed texture. When a small proportion of gravel is part of the feed texture, bed load transport rate asymptotically approaches the feed rate. However, when a significant fraction of gravel is part of the feed grain size distribution, bed load transport rate approaches the feed rate by following an oscillatory path. These findings have been verified in terms of a one-dimensional numerical model. This modeling reveals that the higher the differences in mobility among the grain sizes contained in the feed texture, the more evident is the nonasymptotic transient trend toward equilibrium.},

abstract = {This paper presents one of the first dedicated studies on mobile bed hydraulics of dam-break flow and the induced sediment transport and morphological evolution. A theoretical model is built upon the conservative laws of shallow water hydrodynamics, and a high-resolution numerical solution of the hyperbolic system is achieved using the total-variation-diminishing version of the second-order weighted average flux method in conjunction with the HLLC approximate Riemann solver and SUPERBEE limiter. It is found that a heavily concentrated and eroding wavefront first develops and then depresses gradually as it propagates downstream. In the early stage of the dam-break, a hydraulic jump is formed around the dam site due to rapid bed erosion, which attenuates progressively as it propagates upstream and eventually disappears. While the backward wave appears to migrate at the same speed as over a fixed bed, the propagation of the forward wavefront shows a complex picture compared to its fixed-bed counterpart as a result of the domination of rapid bed erosion initially, the density difference between the wavefront and the downstream ambient water in the intermediate period, and the pattern of the deformed bed profile in the long term. It is also found that the free surface profiles and hydrographs are greatly modified by bed mobility, which has considerable implications for flood prediction. The computed wave structure in the intermediate period exhibits great resemblance to available experiments qualitatively, and yet the existence of a shear wave is found in lieu of a secondary rarefaction postulated in an existing analysis. Finally, the use of the complete, rather than simplified, conservation equations is shown to be essential for correct resolution of the wave and bed structures, which suggests that previous models need reformulating. {\textcopyright} ASCE.},

abstract = {We show by explicit closed form calculations that a Hurst exponent H ≠ frac(1, 2) does not necessarily imply long time correlations like those found in fractional Brownian motion (fBm). We construct a large set of scaling solutions of Fokker-Planck partial differential equations (pdes) where H ≠ frac(1, 2). Thus Markov processes, which by construction have no long time correlations, can have H ≠ frac(1, 2). If a Markov process scales with Hurst exponent H ≠ frac(1, 2) then it simply means that the process has nonstationary increments. For the scaling solutions, we show how to reduce the calculation of the probability density to a single integration once the diffusion coefficient D (x, t) is specified. As an example, we generate a class of student-t-like densities from the class of quadratic diffusion coefficients. Notably, the Tsallis density is one member of that large class. The Tsallis density is usually thought to result from a nonlinear diffusion equation, but instead we explicitly show that it follows from a Markov process generated by a linear Fokker-Planck equation, and therefore from a corresponding Langevin equation. Having a Tsallis density with H ≠ frac(1, 2) therefore does not imply dynamics with correlated signals, e.g., like those of fBm. A short review of the requirements for fBm is given for clarity, and we explain why the usual simple argument that H ≠ frac(1, 2) implies correlations fails for Markov processes with scaling solutions. Finally, we discuss the question of scaling of the full Green function g (x, t ; x′, t′) of the Fokker-Planck pdes. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The equation can be applied to multiple size fractions and ensures smooth transition of sediment variables between bed load and suspended load for each size fraction.

abstract = {Seismic records and evidence from sediment cores at Chilliwack Lake provide the basis for a long-term (postglacial) sediment budget for a 324-km 2 Cordilleran catchment. Chilliwack Lake (11.8km 2 surface area), situated in the North Cascade Mountains, near Chilliwack, British Columbia, was formed behind a valley-wide recessional moraine in the final phase of post-Fraser alpine glaciation. Seismic surveys highlight the postglacial lacustrine record, which is underlain by a thick layer of sediments related to deglacial sedimentation. Sediment cores provide details of grain-size fining from the delta to the distal lake basin. The cores also show a record of intermittent fire and debris flows. Magnetic measurements of lake sediments provide information on grain size, as well as a dating framework. The total postglacial lake-floor deposit volume is estimated to be 397 ± 27 × 10 6m 3. Including estimates of fan and delta deposition, the specific postglacial yield to the lake is calculated to be ∼86 ± 13Mgkm 2a -1. The sediment volume in the uppermost (Holocene) lacustrine layer is 128 ± 9 × 10 6m 3, representing ∼41 ± 4Mgkm 2a -1 in the Holocene. Compared with other Cordilleran lakes of similar size, particularly those with glacial cover in the watershed, Chilliwack Lake has experienced relatively modest rates of sediment accumulation. This study provides an important contribution to a growing database of long-term (postglacial) sediment yield data for major Cordilleran lakes, essential for advancing our understanding of the pace of landscape evolution in formerly glaciated mountainous regions. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {Estimates of sediment transport rates in gravel-bed rivers are typically developed from formulae or from a sampling campaign. The former are notoriously inaccurate; the latter require a large effort and may still not achieve acceptable accuracy. A wide range of geomorphological problems, particularly those at the watershed scale, could be addressed more accurately if reliable local estimates of transport rate could be incorporated routinely into such studies. This requires a method for estimating transport rate with acceptable accuracy and a minimum of effort. A consistent approach to estimating transport is not just a matter of which formula or sampler to use; a suitable approach requires a consistent and reliable scaling of the water discharge and an integral description of the sediment that is both meaningful and practical. An approach proposed here, using a few observations of small transport rates to calibrate a transport formula, is likely to provide a superior combination of accuracy and effort and substantially reduces flow-scaling error. Small transport rates can be measured effectively using pit samplers, which allow the sampling periods needed for accurate measurements. Grain size can be represented as two fractions, sand and gravel, which capture some of the important transport dynamics and effectively represent important environmental problems within a tractable methodological approach. The approach is nearly independent of the uncertainty associated with measuring slope and bed grain-size in the field. Copyright},

The characteristics of the vertical velocity profile of sediment particles in the sheetflow regime, which were reported in previous experiments, are reproduced well by the present simulation. Furthermore, the mechanism to determine the velocity profile of the sediment particles is clarified from the viewpoint of the granular material dynamics.

abstract = {The entrainment of coarse sediment particles under the action of fluctuating hydrodynamic forces is investigated from an energy perspective. It is demonstrated that the entrainment of a grain resting on the channel boundary is possible when the instantaneous flow power transferred to it exceeds a critical level. Its complete removal from the bed matrix occurs only if the impinging flow events supply sufficient mechanical energy. The energy-based criterion is formulated theoretically for entrainment of individual spherical particles in both saltation and rolling modes. Out of the wide range of flow events that can perform mechanical work on a coarse grain, only those with sufficient power and duration or equivalent energy density and characteristic length scale may accomplish its complete dislodgement. The instantaneous velocity upstream of a mobile particle is synchronously recorded with its position, enabling the identification of the flow events responsible for grain entrainment by rolling at near incipient motion flow conditions. For each of the entrainment events, the energy transfer coefficient defined as the ratio of the mechanical work performed on the particle to the mean energy of the flow event responsible for its dislodgement obtains values ranging from 0.04 to 0.10. At the examined low-mobility flow conditions, the majority (about 80{\%}) of the energetic structures leading to complete particle entrainment have a characteristic length of about two to four particle diameters. {\textcopyright} 2013.

abstract = {Channel form and sediment transport are closely linked in alluvial rivers, and as such the development of a conceptual framework for the downstream controls on particle mobility and likely deposition sites has immense value in terms of the way we understand and predictively model rivers. Despite the development of conceptual models which frame flood-scale particle transport distance (termed path length) as a function of channel bar locations, an understanding of the controls on such path lengths in braided rivers remains especially elusive, in large part due to the difficulty in explicitly linking morphology and particle transport distances in the field. Here we utilize a series of laboratory flume experiments to link path length distances with channel morphology. Our morphologic characterization is based on ultrahigh-resolution digital elevation models and bar classifications derived from structure-from-motion topography, while we simultaneously capture particle path lengths using fluorescent tracer particles over the course of five physical model simulations. Our findings underscore the importance of channel bars in acting as deposition sites for particles in transport; 81{\%} of recovered tracers were found in association with compound, point, lateral, or diagonal bars. Bar heads (29{\%}) and bar margins (41{\%}) were the most common bar-related deposition surfaces for recovered tracers. Peaks in particle deposition frequency corresponding to channel bars were often noted on path length distributions from tracer data; most tracers were deposited in areas that had experienced shallow ($\Delta$z = 0.002 m) deposition. Average path length distance (2.5 m) was closely related to average confluence-diffluence spacing (2.3 m) across all runs. The transferability of this understanding to braided streams has important implications for the development of simplified morphodynamic models which seek to predict braided channel evolution across multiflood timescales.},

abstract = {We report the first measurements of friction angles for a naturally formed gravel streambed. For a given test grain size placed on a bed surface, friction angles varied from 10° to over 100°; friction angle distributions can be expressed as a function of test grain size, median bed grain size, and bed sorting parameter. Friction angles decrease with increasing grain size relative to the median bed grain size, and are a systematic function of sorting, with lower friction angles associated with poorer sorting. The probability distributions of critical shear stress for different grain sizes on a given bed surface, as calculated from our friction angle data, show a common origin, but otherwise diverge with larger grains having narrower and lower ranges of critical shear stresses. The potential mobility of a grain, as defined by its probability distribution of critical shear stress, may be overestimated for larger grains in this analysis, because our calculations do not take into account the effects of grain burial and altered near‐bed flow fields.

abstract = {The current work presents a sensitivity study of selected numerical parameters on the large-eddy simulation–discrete element method predictions of sediment transport in a unidirectional open turbulent channel. The sensitivity of the particle friction factor, restitution coefficient, and spring stiffness used in the soft sphere collision model is tested in the three regimes of sediment transport comprising of essentially no motion, bed load, and suspended load flow regimes. The simulations are run for 10 s using base values of the parameters of interest (reference calculation), then one parameter is changed at a time and the corresponding change in quantitative result is observed for the following 15 s where averaged results in the last 10 s are compared to the reference calculation. The sensitivity analysis shows that the underpredicted sediment transport in the suspended load regime can be bridged by moderately decreasing the friction factor of the particles from 0.6 to 0.25. The impact of the same change in bed load regime is not as significant. Both the coefficient of restitution and the particle stiffness show less significant to negligible impact as compared to the friction factor.},

Savage's model provides results that capture experimental trends well and yield the correct magnitude for velocity and discharge for regime A, but it reproduces the dependence of the discharge on the channel slope for only a narrow range of slopes [S.

abstract = {Bed particle entrainment by turbulent wall-shear flow is a key topic of interest in hydrodynamics because it plays a major role to govern the planetary morphodynamics. In this paper, the state-of-the-art review of the essential mechanisms governing the bed particle entrainment by turbulent wall-shear flow and their mathematical modeling is presented. The paper starts with the appraisal of the earlier multifaceted ideas in modeling the particle entrainment highlighting the rolling, sliding, and lifting modes of entrainment. Then, various modeling approaches of bed particle entrainment, such as deterministic, stochastic, and spatiotemporal approaches, are critically analyzed. The modeling criteria of particle entrainment are distinguished for hydraulically smooth, transitional, and rough flow regimes. In this context, the responses of particle size, particle exposure, and packing condition to the near-bed turbulent flow that shears the particles to entrain are discussed. From the modern experimental outcomes, the conceptual mechanism of particle entrainment from the viewpoint of near-bed turbulent coherent structures is delineated. As the latest advancement of the subject, the paper sheds light on the origin of the primitive empirical formulations of bed particle entrainment deriving the scaling laws of threshold flow velocity of bed particle motion from the perspective of the phenomenological theory of turbulence. Besides, a model framework that provides a new look on the bed particle entrainment phenomenon stemming from the stochastic-cum-spatiotemporal approach is introduced. Finally, the future scope of research is articulated with open questions.},

@article{Pelosi2014,
abstract = {Here we consider the 1-D morphodynamics of an erodible bed subject to bedload transport. Fluvial bed elevation variation is typically modeled by the Exner equation, which, in its classical form, expresses mass conservation in terms of the divergence of the bedload sediment flux. An entrainment form of the Exner equation can be written as an alternative description of the same bedload processes, by introducing the notions of an entrainment rate into bedload and of a particle step length, and assuming a certain probability distribution for the step length. This entrainment form implies some degree of nonlocality, which is absent from the standard flux form, so that these two expressions, which are different ways to look at same conservation principle (i.e., sediment continuity), may no longer become equivalent in cases when channel complexity and flow conditions allow for long particle saltation steps (including, but not limited to the case where particle step length has a heavy tailed distribution) or when the domain of interest is not long compared to the step length (e.g., laboratory scales, or saltation over relatively smooth surfaces). We perform a systematic analysis of the effects of the nonlocality in the entrainment form of the Exner equation on transient aggradational/degradational bed profiles by using the flux form as a benchmark. As expected, the two forms converge to the same results as the step length converges to zero, in which case nonlocality is negligible. As step length increases relative to domain length, the mode of aggradation changes from an upward-concave form to a rotational, and then eventually a downward-concave form. Corresponding behavior is found for the case of degradation. These results may explain anomalously flat, aggradational, long profiles that have been observed in some short laboratory flume experiments.},

@article{Gillespie1977,
abstract = {There are two formalisms for mathematically describing the time behavior of a spatially homogeneous chemical system: The deterministic approach regards the time evolution as a continuous, wholly predictable process which is governed by a set of coupled, ordinary differential equations (the "reaction-rate equations"); the stochastic approach regards the time evolution as a kind of random-walk process which is governed by a single differential-difference equation (the "master equation"). Fairly simple kinetic theory arguments show that the stochastic formulation of chemical kinetics has a firmer physical basis than the deterministic formulation, but unfortunately the stochastic master equation is often mathematically intractable. There is, however, a way to make exact numerical calculations within the framework of the stochastic formulation without having to deal with the master equation directly. It is a relatively simple digital computer algorithm which uses a rigorously derived Monte Carlo procedure to numerically simulate the time evolution of the given chemical system. Like the master equation, this "stochastic simulation algorithm" correctly accounts for the inherent fluctuations and correlations that are necessarily ignored in the deterministic formulation. In addition, unlike most procedures for numerically solving the deterministic reaction-rate equations, this algorithm never approximates infinitesimal time increments dt by finite time steps $\Delta$t. The feasibility and utility of the simulation algorithm are demonstrated by applying it to several well-known model chemical systems, including the Lotka model, the Brusselator, and the Oregonator.},

@article{Ancey2010,
abstract = {Even under flow equilibrium conditions, river bed topography continuously evolves with time, producing trains of irregular bed forms. The idea has recently emerged that the variability in the bed form geometry results from some randomness in sediment flux. In this paper, we address this issue by using the Exner equation and a population exchange model derived in an earlier paper. In this model, particle entrainment and deposition are idealized as population exchanges between the stream and the bed, which makes it possible to use birth-death Markov process theory to track the number of moving grains. The paper focuses on nascent bed forms on initially planar beds, a situation in which the coupling between the stream and bed is weak. In a steady state, the number of moving particles follows a negative binomial distribution. Although this probability distribution does not enter the family of heavy-tailed distributions, it may give rise to large and frequent fluctuations because the standard deviation can be much larger than the mean, a feature that is not accounted for with classic probability laws (e.g., Hamamori's law) used so far for describing bed load fluctuations. In the large-system limit, the master equation of the birth-death Markov process can be transformed into a Fokker-Planck equation. This transformation is used here to show that the number of moving particles can be described as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. An important consequence is that in the long term, the number of moving particles follows a Gaussian distribution. Laboratory experiments show that this approximation is correct when the mean number per unit length of stream, {\$}\backslashbar{\{}N{\}}{\$}/L, is sufficiently large (typically two particles per centimeter in our experiments). The particle number fluctuations give rise to bed elevation fluctuations, whose spectrum falls off like {\&}{\#}969;{\&}{\#}8722;2 in the high-frequency regime (with {\&}{\#}969; the angular frequency) and variance grows linearly with time. These features are in agreement with recent observations on bed form development (in particular, ripple growth).},

abstract = {A consensus has formed that the step length distribution of fluvial bed load is thin tailed and that the observed anomalous superdiffusion of bed load tracer particles must arise from heavy-tailed resting times. However, heavy-tailed resting times have never been directly observed in the field over multiple floods. Using 9 years of data from a large bed load tracer experiment, I show that the spatial variance of the tracer plume scales faster than linearly with integrated excess stream power, indicating anomalous superdiffusion. The superdiffusion is caused by a heavy-tailed distribution of observed storage times that is fit with a truncated Pareto distribution with a tail parameter that is predicted by anomalous diffusion theory. The heavy-tailed distribution of storage times causes the tracer virtual velocity to slow over time, indicated by a sublinear increase in the mean displacement that is predicted by the storage time distribution tail parameter.},

abstract = {We discuss a renewal process in which successive events are separated by scale-free waiting time periods. Among other ubiquitous long-time properties, this process exhibits aging: events counted initially in a time interval [0, t] statistically strongly differ from those observed at later times [ta, ta + t]. The versatility of renewal theory is owed to its abstract formulation. Renewals can be interpreted as steps of a random walk, switching events in two-state models, domain crossings of a random motion, etc. In complex, disordered media, processes with scale-free waiting times play a particularly prominent role. We set up a unified analytical foundation for such anomalous dynamics by discussing in detail the distribution of the aging renewal process. We analyze its half-discrete, half-continuous nature and study its aging time evolution. These results are readily used to discuss a scale-free anomalous diffusion process, the continuous-time random walk. By this, we not only shed light on the profound origins of its characteristic features, such as weak ergodicity breaking, along the way, we also add an extended discussion on aging effects. In particular, we find that the aging behavior of time and ensemble averages is conceptually very distinct, but their time scaling is identical at high ages. Finally, we show how more complex motion models are readily constructed on the basis of aging renewal dynamics.},

abstract = {This paper outlines the various approaches used to calculate bedload transport. As bedload transport exhibits considerable spatial and temporal variations, computing the bedload transport rates and morphological changes experienced by streambeds is difficult. A large body of experimental work has revealed scaling laws relating the mean transport rate qs to hydraulic conditions (that is, water discharge qw, bottom shear stress $\tau$b or stream power $\omega$): $\omega$): qs $\alpha$ qw, qs $\alpha$ $\tau$3/2b or qs $\alpha$ $\omega$.. The most common approach used to calculate bedload transport has thus long involved determining the one-to-one function qs = f (qw) (or any other dependence of qs on $\tau$b or $\omega$) from experiments or theoretical considerations. However, the predictive power of such relationships is limited: scientists are unable to predict qs to within better than one order of magnitude, and morphodynamic models based on qs = f (qw) fail to explain the development of bedforms without the use of additional assumptions. Progressively, other calculation approaches have appeared, with many relying on the idea that bedload transport is a macroscopic transport process that primarily reflects random particle motion at the grain scale. The present paper reviews the main ideas being explored today.},

abstract = {In gravel bed rivers, bed load transport exhibits considerable variability in time and space. Recently, stochastic bed load transport theories have been developed to address the mechanisms and effects of bed load transport fluctuations. Stochastic models involve parameters such as particle diffusivity, entrainment, and deposition rates. The lack of hard information on how these parameters vary with flow conditions is a clear impediment to their application to real-world scenarios. In this paper, we determined the closure equations for the above parameters from laboratory experiments. We focused on shallow supercritical flow on a sloping mobile bed in straight channels, a setting that was representative of flow conditions in mountain rivers. Experiments were run at low sediment transport rates under steady nonuniform flow conditions (i.e., the water discharge was kept constant, but bed forms developed and migrated upstream, making flow nonuniform). Using image processing, we reconstructed particle paths to deduce the particle velocity and its probability distribution, particle diffusivity, and rates of deposition and entrainment. We found that on average, particle acceleration, velocity, and deposition rate were responsive to local flow conditions, whereas entrainment rate depended strongly on local bed activity. Particle diffusivity varied linearly with the depth-averaged flow velocity. The empirical probability distribution of particle velocity was well approximated by a Gaussian distribution when all particle positions were considered together. In contrast, the particles located in close vicinity to the bed had exponentially distributed velocities. Our experimental results provide closure equations for stochastic or deterministic bed load transport models.},

Closure is the relationship between the parameters required by advection diffusion forumations of sediment transport rate to measurable channel parameters.

There are a few unique contributions such as average particle velocity as a function of particle elevation. Two methods are described for calculating particle diffusivity.

abstract = {A geomorphic transport law is a mathematical statement derived from a physical principle or mechanism, which expresses the mass flux or erosion caused by one or more processes in a manner that: 1) can be parameterized from field measurements, 2) can be tested in physical models, and 3) can be applied over geo-morphically significant spatial and temporal scales. Such laws are a compromise between physics-based theory that requires extensive information about materials and their interactions, which may be hard to quantify across real landscapes, and rules-based approaches, which cannot be tested directly but only can be used in models to see if the model outcomes match some expected or observed state. We propose that landscape evolution modeling can be broadly categorized into detailed, apparent, statistical and essential realism models and it is the latter, concerned with explaining mechanistically the essential morphodynamic features of a landscape, in which geomorphic transport laws are most effectively applied. A limited number of studies have provided verification and parameterization of geomorphic transport laws for: linear slope-dependent transport, non-linear transport due to dilational disturbance of soil, soil production from bedrock, and river incision into bedrock. Field parameterized geomorphic transport laws, however, are lacking for many processes including landslides, debris flows, surface wash, and glacial scour. We propose the use of high- resolution topography, as initial conditions, in landscape evolution models and explore the applicability of locally parameterized geomorphic transport laws in explaining hillslope morphology in the Oregon Coast Range. This modeling reveals unexpected morphodynamics, suggesting that the use of real landscapes with geomorphic transport laws may provide new insights about the linkages between process and form.},

We focus particularly on the fluctuations of particle activity, which is defined as the number of moving particles per unit bed length. Based on a stochastic model recently proposed by Ancey and Heyman (2014), we derive the second moment of particle activity analytically, that is, the spatial correlation functions of particle activity. From these expressions, we show that large moving particle clusters can develop spatially. Also, we provide evidence that fluctuations of particle activity are scale dependent. Two characteristic lengths emerge from the model: a saturation length ..sat describing the length needed for a perturbation in particle activity to relax to the homogeneous solution and a correlation length ..c describing the typical size of moving particle clusters. A dimensionless Peclet number can also be defined according to the transport model. Three different experimental data sets are used to test the theoretical results. We show that the stochastic model describes spatial patterns of particle activity well at all scales. In particular, we show that ..c and ..sat may be relatively large compared to typical scales encountered in bed load experiments (grain diameter, water depth, bed form wavelength, flume length, etc.) suggesting that the spatial fluctuations of particle activity have a nonnegligible impact on the average transport process.},

abstract = {A two-dimensional simulation model of travel distances of individual particles in a gravel-bed river is presented. The model is based on a number of rules, which include particle size, entrainment, trajectory, distance of movement and entrapment. Particle interactions are controlled by resistance fields defined about each obstacle and critical elevation defined in the model. Resistance fields, particle dropping and critical elevation rules control particle interactions. The interaction rules cause the particles to develop pebble clusters, stone cells and transverse structures (transverse ribs). The simulated travel distances of individual particles are consistent with reported field results. Individual particle travel distances were simulated using two different models; one without interactions between the individual particles and the stationary bed and one with interactions. The case without interactions demonstration the random nature of sediment transport, and narrow ranges of travel distances. Wider ranges of travel distances, similar to those for natural situations, were obtained for the cases with interactions. The more intense the interaction between the mobile stones and the stationary ones, the wider the range of distances of travel for a given particle size. Modelling the mean travel distance yielded a result similar to that published previously, which was based on empirical data. Well developed bed-surface structures were obtained for relatively poorly sorted sediment with intense interactions between particles. Transverse structures developed when relatively large particles were allowed to move. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2002 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {We present a model of one-dimensional symmetric and asymmetric random walks. The model is applied to an experiment studying fluid transport in a rapidly rotating annulus. In the model, random walkers alternate between flights (steps of constant velocity) and sticking (pauses between flights). Flight time and sticking time probability distribution functions (PDFs) have power law decays: P(t) ∼ t-$\mu$ and t-$\nu$ for flights and sticking, respectively. We calculate the dependence of the variance exponent $\gamma$($\sigma$2 ∼ t$\gamma$) on the PDF exponents $\mu$ and $\nu$. For a broad distribution of flight times ($\mu$ {\textless} 3), the motion is superdiffusive (1 {\textless} $\gamma$ {\textless} 2), and the PDF has a divergent second moment, i.e., it is a L{\'{e}}vy distribution. For a broad distribution of sticking times ($\nu$ {\textless} 3), either superdiffusion or subdiffusion ($\gamma$ {\textless} 1) can occur, with qualitative differences between symmetric and asymmetric walks. For narrow PDFs ($\mu$ {\textgreater} 3, $\nu$ {\textgreater} 3), normal diffusion ($\gamma$ = 1) is recovered. Predictions of the model are related to experimental observations of transport in a rotating annulus. The Eulerian velocity field is chaotic, yet it is still possible to distinguish between well-defined sticking events (particles trapped in vortices) and flights (particles making long excursions in a jet). The distribution of flight lengths is well described by a power law with a divergent second moment (L{\'{e}}vy distribution). The observed transport is strongly asymmetric and is well described by the proposed model. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1996 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

However, a naive extension of the threshold theory of canals in coarse alluvium to straight reaches of gravel rivers leads to the stable-channel paradox: Transport of bed material is incompatible with a stable width. In this paper singular perturbation techniques are used to obtain a bed stress distribution which allows a mobile bed but immobile banks at bankfull or dominant discharge. This result is used to obtain regime relations for straight rivers with bed and banks composed of coarse gravel.

abstract = {Sediment tracers are increasingly employed to estimate bed load transport and landscape evolution rates. Tracer trajectories are dominated by periods of immobility ("waiting times") as they are buried and reexcavated in the stochastically evolving river bed. Here we model bed evolution as a random walk with mean-reverting tendency (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process) originating from the restoring effect of erosion and deposition. The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model contains two parameters, a and b, related to the particle feed rate and range of bed elevation fluctuations, respectively. Observations of bed evolution in flume experiments agree with model predictions; in particular, the model reproduces the asymptotic t{\textless}inf{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} tail in the tracer waiting time exceedance probability distribution. This waiting time distribution is similar to that inferred for tracers in natural gravel streams and avalanching rice piles, indicating applicability of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck mean-reverting model to many disordered transport systems with tracer burial and excavation.},

Based on the concept of Fourier descriptors for sand grains proposed recently by the same authors, we first randomly generate three 2D contours of cross-section for a real sand particle in three orthogonal planes, and then develop a morphing technique to construct the external 3D surface of the particle to match these cross-sections. The proposed method is examined by application to the generation of six sands reported in the literature using the Fourier spectrums available for these sands. We show that with a proper correction on the smoothness and roundness of the orthogonal projection calibrated from the six sands, the method can generate fairly consistent results as compared to the real sands. Further validation of the proposed method on another three sands shows satisfactory performance. The advantages and limitations of the method, as well as relevant future applications of the work to granular material modelling are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

@article{Heyman2014a,
abstract = {This thesis addresses the problem of a statistical description of the transport of sediment as bed load. It highlights the role of fluctuations arising during the transport process, and their impact on macroscopic averages. The results presented here are based on four experimental studies. Two of them were published recently by B{\"{o}}hm et al. [2004] and Roseberry et al. [2012] while the other two were carried out during the thesis. In particular, two high speed cameras were used to automatically reconstruct particle trajectories over a window of approximately 1mlength, continuously over a few minutes. This constitutes, at the time of writing, one of the largest sets of experimental particle trajectory data available. Based on these experiments, two probabilistic models are proposed. The first one offers a macroscopic picture of the fluctuations of particle activity (concentration of moving particles). Based on a model recently proposed by Ancey et al. [2008], it allows for the accurate prediction of the fluctuations observed in the bed load flux. A new formula for the probability density function of the volume-averaged bed load flux is derived and compared to experimental data as well as to existing theory. By slightly modifying the original model, it was also possible to derive the probability density function of the inter-arrival time of particles. The latter shows an unusual bimodal shape due to the effect of collective entrainment. This phenomenon is referred to as the “separation of time scales” [Heyman et al., 2013]. Although providing an accurate picture of the macroscopic fluctuations arising in bed load transport, the first model does not gather information about the spatial behaviour of the bed load flux fluctuations. To remedy this, a new probabilistic model, able to locally describe the transport process, is proposed. This model lies in-between a kinetic description of the transport process and the macroscopic model proposed by Ancey et al. [2008]. In this regard, only the particle positions are treated as random variables, while particle velocities are assumed to be close to theMaxwellian equilibrium distribution. By a careful analysis of first and second moments, in both spatial and temporal dimensions, I prove the occurrence of large correlated structures that strongly perturb the average equilibrium, while not fundamentally modifying it. Moreover, I show that the validity of Taylor's frozen flow hypothesis for bed load transport is severely called into question by the experimental data, proving the peculiar behaviour of those structures during transport by the mean vii Remerciements fluid flow. Finally, a discussion about scales of fluctuations is provided. It follows from experimental results, as well as from theoretical predictions, that local fluctuations may play an important role in both an experimental setup and natural rivers. Indeed, the saturation and the correlation lengths are often so large that fluctuations may interact in a non-trivial way with the boundaries of the system, precluding the use of macroscopic average equations. Finally, this thesis suggests that the inherent fluctuations of bed load transport rates may need to be taken into account in numerical simulations in order to accurately describe the transport process.},

abstract = {When a system jams, it undergoes a transition from a flowing to a rigid state. Despite this important change in the dynamics, the internal structure of the system remains disordered in the solid as well as the fluid phase. In this way jamming is quite different from crystallization, the other common way in which a fluid solidifies. Jamming is a paradigm for thinking about how many different types of fluids - from molecular liquids to macroscopic granular matter - develop rigidity. Here we review recent work on the jamming transition. We start with perhaps the simplest model: frictionless spheres interacting via repulsive finite-range forces at zero temperature. In this highly idealized case, the transition has aspects of both first- and second-order transitions. From studies of the normal modes of vibration for the marginally jammed solid, new physics has emerged for how a material can be rigid without having the elastic properties of a normal solid. We first survey the simulation data and theoretical arguments that have been proposed to understand this behavior. We then review work that has systematically gone beyond the ideal model to see whether the scenario developed there is more generally applicable. This includes work that examines the effect of nonspherical particles, friction, and temperature on the excitations and the dynamics. We briefly touch on recent laboratory experiments that have begun to make contact with simulations and theory. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2010 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.},

Although stream ecologists know that river channel and floodplain habitats used by aquatic organisms are maintained by hydrologic regimes that mobilize gravel-bed sediments, terrestrial ecologists have largely been unaware of the importance of floodplain structures and processes to the life requirements of a wide variety of species. We provide insight into gravel-bed rivers as the ecological nexus of glaciated mountain landscapes. We show why gravel-bed river floodplains are the primary arena where interactions take place among aquatic, avian, and terrestrial species from microbes to grizzly bears and provide essential connectivity as corridors for movement for both aquatic and terrestrial species. Paradoxically, gravel-bed river floodplains are also disproportionately unprotected where human developments are concentrated. Structural modifications to floodplains such as roads, railways, and housing and hydrologicaltering hydroelectric or water storage dams have severe impacts to floodplain habitat diversity and productivity, restrict local and regional connectivity, and reduce the resilience of both aquatic and terrestrial species, including adaptation to climate change. To be effective, conservation efforts in glaciated mountain landscapes intended to benefit the widest variety of organisms need a paradigm shift that has gravel-bed rivers and their floodplains as the central focus and that prioritizes the maintenance or restoration of the intact structure and processes of these critically important systems throughout their length and breadth.},

abstract = {Sediment transport in rivers consists, at moderate discharge stage, of individual grains that undergo a series of step movements and rest periods (bed-load). Following a large number of grain trajectories in time and space is difficult and the results are affected by bias due to censorship of the time-spatial window. Therefore, the data sets available for the description of the statistics of resting-Times, travel-Time and lengths of the steps, are still insufficient. In this paper, an innovative experimental methodology has been designed and applied to get data representing the evolution of a bed surface and to support a robust statistical analysis of sediment transport. The methodology is based on image sequences taken of a flat bed made of well-sorted (mono-dispersed) particles. The acquired data are interpreted analytically through equations that describe the effects of grain entrainment and deposition. We show that grains' displacement have a mean value independent of bed-load rate under low to moderate transport intensity for a given sediment type and bed-slope. Hence, we provide a strong validation of the seminal conjecture of Einstein in his theoretical statistical description of sediment transport. Finally, we describe the probability density functions of the resting-Time for a few values of the sediment discharge.},

abstract = {Persistent random walks are intermediate transport processes between a uniform rectilinear motion and a Brownian motion. They are formed by successive steps of random finite lengths and directions travelled at a fixed speed. The isotropic and symmetric 1D persistent random walk is governed by the telegrapher's equation, also called the hyperbolic heat conduction equation. These equations have been designed to resolve the paradox of the infinite speed in the heat and diffusion equations. The finiteness of both the speed and the correlation length leads to several classes of random walks: Persistent random walk in one dimension can display anomalies that cannot arise for Brownian motion such as anisotropy and asymmetries. In this work we focus on the case where the mean free path is anisotropic, the only anomaly leading to a physics that is different from the telegrapher's case. We derive exact expression of its Green's function, for its scattering statistics and distribution of first-passage time at the origin. The phenomenology of the latter shows a transition for quantities like the escape probability and the residence time.},

abstract = {We describe the joint dynamics of bedload transport and bed elevation changes with a stochastic population model, and we analyze (1) the dependence of bedload flux statistics on local bed elevations and (2) resting time distributions for sediment undergoing burial in the fluctuating sedimentary bed. The model involves entrainment and deposition in a control volume characterized by elevation-dependent rates, and it exhibits a statistical regulation effect, whereby bed aggradation suppresses the variance of the bedload flux while degradation enhances it. This variance regulation effect is contingent on collective entrainment, whereby moving grains destabilize stationary grains in a positive feedback. When collective entrainment is turned off,bedload transport fluctuations become independent of the bed elevation. Return times from above in the bed elevation time series provide heavy-tailed power law distributions of resting times with tail behavior characterized by the mean erosion rate and the active layer depth. These results imply bedload statistics measurements on relatively short timescales can be strongly biased by bed elevation changes when collective entrainment occurs, and they support the growing consensus that sediment burial generates heavy-tailed sediment resting times that ultimately generate anomalous bedload diffusion.},

abstract = {The emerging diffusive dynamics in many complex systems show a characteristic crossover behaviour from anomalous to normal diffusion which is otherwise fitted by two independent power-laws. A prominent example for a subdiffusive-diffusive crossover are viscoelastic systems such as lipid bilayer membranes, while superdiffusive-diffusive crossovers occur in systems of actively moving biological cells. We here consider the general dynamics of a stochastic particle driven by so-called tempered fractional Gaussian noise, that is noise with Gaussian amplitude and power-law correlations, which are cut off at some mesoscopic time scale. Concretely we consider such noise with built-in exponential or power-law tempering, driving an overdamped Langevin equation (fractional Brownian motion) and fractional Langevin equation motion. We derive explicit expressions for the mean squared displacement and correlation functions, including different shapes of the crossover behaviour depending on the concrete tempering, and discuss the physical meaning of the tempering. In the case of power-law tempering we also find a crossover behaviour from faster to slower superdiffusion and slower to faster subdiffusion. As a direct application of our model we demonstrate that the obtained dynamics quantitatively describes the subdiffusion-diffusion and subdiffusion-subdiffusion crossover in lipid bilayer systems. We also show that a model of tempered fractional Brownian motion recently proposed by Sabzikar and Meerschaert leads to physically very different behaviour with a seemingly paradoxical ballistic long time scaling.},

abstract = {In the last decade several efforts were devoted to model sediment-particle transport in rivers as a stochastic process. Experimental observations are therefore needed to validate these models and to provide the correct probability distribution of selected stochastic variables. The kinematics of sand particles is investigated here using nonintrusive imaging to provide a statistical description of bedload transport under incipient motion conditions. In particular, we focus on the alternation between motion (particle steps) and rest regimes to quantify the probabilistic distribution of the particles waiting time, which is suggested by many studies to be responsible for anomalous diffusion. The probability distributions of the particle step time and step length, streamwise and spanwise velocities, acceleration, and waiting time are quantified experimentally. Results suggest that variables describing the particle motion regime are thin-tailed distributed, whereas the waiting times exhibit a power law distribution. A specific class of waiting times during which the grain is observed to oscillate without a net displacement is classified as active and is analyzed separately from the other, so-called deep waiting times. The experimental results, obtained under five different transport conditions, describe grain-scale kinematics and dynamics at different wall shear stress. They provide both a benchmark data set for validating particle-transport numerical simulation and critical input parameters for the stochastic modeling of bedload transport.},

The book is primarily focused, since most up-to-date research findings in the field are presented, on the research aspects that involve a comprehensive knowledge of sediment dynamics in turbulent flows. It begins with the fundamentals of hydrodynamics and particle motion followed by turbulence characteristics related to sediment motion. Then, the sediment dynamics is analysed from a classical perspective by applying the mean bed shear approach and additionally incorporating a statistical description for the role of turbulence. The work finally examines the local scour problems at hydraulic structures and scale models. It is intended to design as a course textbook in graduate / research level and a guide for the field engineers as well, keeping up with modern technological developments. Therefore, as a simple prerequisite, the background of the readers should have a basic knowledge in hydraulics in undergraduate level and an understanding of fundamentals of calculus.},

abstract = {In this work we develop a reduced-complexity model (RCM) for river delta formation (referred to as DeltaRCM in the following). It is a rule-based cellular morphodynamic model, in contrast to reductionist models based on detailed computational fluid dynamics. The basic framework of this model (DeltaRCM) consists of stochastic parcel-based cellular routing schemes for water and sediment and a set of phenomenological rules for sediment deposition and erosion. The outputs of the model include a depth-averaged flow field, water surface elevation and bed topography that evolve in time. Results show that DeltaRCM is able (1) to resolve a wide range of channel dynamics - including elongation, bifurcation, avulsion and migration - and (2) to produce a variety of deltas such as alluvial fan deltas and deltas with multiple orders of bifurcations. We also demonstrate a simple stratigraphy recording component which tracks the distribution of coarse and fine materials and the age of the deposits. Essential processes that must be included in reduced-complexity delta models include a depth-averaged flow field that guides sediment transport a nontrivial water surface profile that accounts for backwater effects at least in the main channels, both bedload and suspended sediment transport, and topographic steering of sediment transport.},

abstract = {Bedload transport generally depends on the bed shear stress and Reynolds number. Many studies conducted for the condition of turbulent flows have revealed the dependence of the transport rate on the bed shear stress, while knowledge of the Reynolds number effect on the transport rate is very limited. As an extreme case to reflect the viscous effect on sediment transport, sediment transport in laminar flows is considered in this paper. A stochastic approach is adopted to explore how the transport rate can be associated with characteristics of laminar flows. First, the probability of erosion in the absence of turbulence is assumed to depend only on the randomness of bed particles. The probability is then applied to formulate the sediment transport rate, of which the derivation is made largely based on Einstein's bedload theory. The theoretical result indicates that the dimensionless transport rate for laminar flows is dependent on the dimensionless shear stress and dimensionless particle diameter or the shear Reynolds number. Comparisons are finally made between the derived formula and an empirical correlation available in the literature. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Modern geomorphology was founded in the nineteenth century as an exercise of historical interpretation of landscapes. After the mid-twentieth century it dominantly became a quest to understand the processes by which landscapes are modified. This focused attention on the measurement of sediment fluxes on synoptic timescales and on a reductionist, Newtonian programme of construction of low-order theories about those fluxes, largely imported from engineering science. The period also saw the emergence of an applied geomorphology. Toward the end of the twentieth century the subject was dramatically transformed by improved technologies for remote sensing and surveying of Earth's surface, the advent of personal computation and of large-scale computation, and important developments of absolute dating techniques. These technical innovations in turn promoted recognition of geomorphology as a 'system science' and facilitated the reintegration of tectonics into geomorphology, opening the way for a renewed consideration of the history of the landscape. Finally, increasing recognition of the dominance of human agency in contemporary modification of Earth's terrestrial surface has become a significant theme. Important influences on the continuing development of the subject will include the search for physically sound laws for material fluxes; reconciling geomorphological information and process representations across spatial and temporal scales, in both observation and theory; comprehending complexity in geomorphological processes and landform histories; incorporating the geomorphological role of living organisms, particularly micro-organisms; understanding the role of climate in geomorphology, both in the contemporary changing climate and in the long term; and fully admitting the now dominant role of humans as geomorphic agents. Geomorphology is simultaneously developing in diverse directions: on one hand, it is becoming a more rigorous geophysical science - a significant part of a larger earth science discipline; on another, it is becoming more concerned with human social and economic values, with environmental change, conservation ethics, with the human impact on environment, and with issues of social justice and equity. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2010.},

abstract = {To explore the causes of history-dependent sediment transport in rivers, we use a 19-year record of coarse sediment transport from a steep channel in Switzerland. We observe a strong dependence of the threshold for sediment motion ($\tau$c) on the magnitude of previous flows for prior shear stresses ranging from 104 to 340 Pa, resulting in seasonally increasing $\tau$c for 10 of 19 years. This stabilization occurs with and without measureable bedload transport, suggesting that small-scale riverbed rearrangement increases $\tau$c. Following large transport events ({\textgreater}340 Pa), this history dependence is disrupted. Bedload tracers suggest that significant reorganization of the bed erases memory of previous flows. We suggest that the magnitude of past flows controls the organization of the bed, which then modifies $\tau$c, paralleling the evolution of granular media under shear. Our results support the use of a state function to better predict variability in bedload sediment transport rates.},

abstract = {Hans A. Einstein initiated a probabilistic approach to modelling sediment transport in rivers. His formulae were based on theory and were stimulated by laboratory investigations. The theory assumes that bed load movement occurs in individual steps of rolling, sliding or saltation and rest periods. So far very few attempts have been made to measure stochastic elements in nature. For the first time this paper presents results of radio-tracing the travel path of individual particles in a large braided gravel bed river: the Waimakariri River of New Zealand. As proposed by Einstein, it was found that rest periods can be modelled by an exponential distribution, but particle step lengths are better represented by a gamma distribution. Einstein assumed an average travel distance of 100 grain-diameters for any bed load particle between consecutive points of deposition, but larger values of 6{\textperiodcentered}7 m or 150 grain-diameters and 6{\textperiodcentered}1 m or 120 grain-diameters were measured for two test particle sizes. Together with other available large scale field data, a dependence of the mean step length on particle diameter relative to the D50 of the bed surface was found. During small floods the time used for movement represents only 2{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} of the total time from erosion to deposition. The increase in percentage of time being used for transport means that it then has to be regarded in stochastic transport models. Tracing the flow path of bed load particles between erosion and deposition sites is a step towards explaining the interactions between sediment transport and river morphology.

abstract = {A simple constitutive framework is used to review some phenomenological models for solid-fluid mixtures. Several successful descriptions of viscoplasticity assume that stress is proportional to a normalized deformation rate. The modulus in this constitutive equation evolves with time for thixotropic materials. This approach is used in most models based on scalar measures of structure. Such measures are determined by an evolution equation that is insensitive to rate reversals during shear flow. This behavior appears to be characteristic of inelastic materials such as an aqueous solution of bentonite. However, the same solution with guargum does not exhibit this response due to elasticity induced by the polymer. Models for granular media extend this constitutive framework by including compressibility effects and a scalar measure of particle interactions. The effect of fluid viscosity on particle interactions is incorporated using a mixture theory approach. Pipe flow of viscoplastic materials and shear flow of granular media are analyzed using boundary conditions that allow slip at solid surfaces. {\textcopyright} 1992 Steinkopff-Verlag.},

Results of 64 gravel-bed field tracer experiments covering a wide range of flow and sediment supply regimes are compiled here to determine the probabilistic character of gravel transport. We focus on whether particle travel distances and waits are thin- or heavy-tailed. While heavy-tailed travel distance distributions are observed between successive monitoring events in different hydrological and sediment supply regimes, heavy-tailedness does not persist through total travel distance over multiple monitoring events, suggesting that individual monitoring events occur before particle travel distance exceeds the characteristic correlation length for the channel (such that particles that start in fast paths remain in fast paths and particles in slow paths remain in slow paths). After a large number of transport events, super-diffusive spreading was not observed at any of the gravel bed streams. Continuous-time tracking of x, y, z coordinates of tracers in natural streams is necessary to capture exact step and waiting time distributions. {\textcopyright} 2013. American Geophysical Union.

abstract = {Sediment transport by wind is one of many processes of interest to the geomorphologist in which grain to grain contacts play an important role. In order to illustrate the modelling of collections of frictional, inelastic sedimentary grains with the particle dynamics method (PDM), we use the grain impact process in aeolian saltation as a specific example. In PDM, all the forces on each particle are evaluated at a sequence of small time‐steps, and the Newtonian equations of motion are integrated forward in time. Interparticle forces at grain contacts are treated as springs with prescribed stiffness (normal force) and by a Coulomb friction law (tangential force); particle inelasticity is represented by spring damping. The granular splash resulting from saltation impacts is assessed for sensitivity to the choice of grain properties, and the integration time‐step. We find that for the range of impact speeds and impactor masses relevant to aeolian settings, grain splashes are relatively insensitive to grain stiffness, grain inelasticity and grain friction, and that the pattern of ejection from the bed is largely controlled by bed microtopography. A large set of impact realizations involving a variety of impact points on a small set of target beds is used to collect the appropriate statistics for describing the stochastic splash process. The splash function representing these statistics is then available for use in calculations over longer time‐scales, such as the evolution of the saltation curtain. The details given here will enable the interested reader to adapt PDM modelling to other types of clastic sedimentary systems. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1993, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

abstract = {Large wood along rivers influences entrainment, transport, and storage of mineral sediment and particulate organic matter. We review how wood alters sediment dynamics and explore patterns among volumes of in-stream wood, sediment storage, and residual pools for dispersed pieces of wood, logjams, and beaver dams. We hypothesized that: volume of sediment per unit area of channel stored in association with wood is inversely proportional to drainage area; the form of sediment storage changes downstream; sediment storage correlates with wood load; the residual volume of pools created in association with wood correlates inversely with drainage area; and volume of sediment stored behind beaver dams correlates with pond area. Lack of data from larger drainage areas limits tests of these hypotheses, but the analyses suggest that sediment volume correlates positively with drainage area and wood volume. The form of sediment storage in relation to wood appears to change downstream, with wedges of sediment upstream from jammed steps most prevalent in small, steep channels and more dispersed sediment storage in lower gradient channels. Pool volume correlates positively with wood volume and negatively with channel gradient. Sediment volume correlates well with beaver pond area. More abundant in-stream wood and beaver populations present historically equated to greater sediment storage within river corridors and greater residual pool volume. One implication of these changes is that protecting and re-introducing wood and beavers can be used to restore rivers.

abstract = {Advances in computing technology, new and ongoing restoration initiatives, concerns about climate change's effects, and the increasing interdisciplinarity of research have encouraged the development of landscape-scale mechanistic models of coupled ecological-geophysical systems. However, communication barriers and uneven infiltration of new strategies for data-driven induction persist in the context of simulation model development across disciplines. One challenge is that ecology and the geosciences have embraced different modeling epistemologies, with ecologists historically favoring inductive inference from generalized, phenomenological models and geoscientists favoring deductive inference from detailed first-principles models. Today, many models used for environmental management, particularly for aquatic ecosystems, tend to be highly detailed, with ecological and geophysical components represented in different modules that are linked but often not closely integrated. These observations highlight a need for cross-disciplinary dialogue about landscape-scale modeling objectives and approaches. The philosophies of pattern-oriented modeling in ecology and exploratory modeling in geophysics have yielded advances in theoretical and applied knowledge in both of those disciplines, but they are not comprehensive across all aspects of landscape-scale modeling. Here we define and synthesize the “Appropriate-Complexity Method” (ACME), which builds upon these two philosophies to guide the development of process-oriented models across a spectrum of scientific and management objectives. ACME helps modelers efficiently converge upon an optimal modeling structure through: i) systematic evaluation of the attributes that comprise computational and representational detail, for which we have developed an operational decision tree; ii) iterative adjustment of models based on pattern-oriented model evaluation strategies; and iii) the use of appropriate datasets (where applicable) to build conceptual models and formulate predictions. Decisions about aspects of computational and representational detail are based on the landscape's emergent properties. They are also based on a hierarchy of classes of questions governing model objectives that represent a multi-attribute tradeoff among validation potential, interpretability, tractability, and generality as functions of computational and representational detail. Tradeoff curves, together with model objectives, provide further guidance for determining the “appropriate” level of complexity for representation of processes in models. Once deemed adequate for addressing the original research question of interest, models may be used for projection and scenario testing. They may next undergo expansion that moves them down the hierarchy, where they can then be used to address research questions of higher specificity, detail, and validation potential, though at a cost of lower tractability and interpretability on the tradeoff curves. This practical, systematic procedure provides clear guidance for the design and improvement of landscape models that may be used to address a wide variety of questions relevant to restoration, over a spectrum of scales.},

abstract = {The influence of grain angularity on the properties of dense flows down a rough inclined plane are investigated. Three-dimensional numerical simulations using the nonsmooth contact dynamics method are carried out with both spherical (rounded) and polyhedral (angular) grain assemblies. Both sphere and polyhedra assemblies abide by the flow start and stop laws, although much higher tilt angle values are required to trigger polyhedral grain flow. In the dense permanent flow regime, both systems show similarities in the bulk of the material (away from the top free surface and the substrate), such as uniform values of the solid fraction, inertial number and coordination number, or linear dependency of the solid fraction and effective friction coefficient with the inertial number. However, discrepancies are also observed between spherical and polyhedral particle flows. A dead (or nearly arrested) zone appears in polyhedral grain flows close to the rough bottom surface, reflected by locally concave velocity profiles, locally larger coordination number and solid fraction values, smaller inertial number values. This dead zone disappears for smooth bottom surfaces. In addition, unlike sphere assemblies, polyhedral grain assemblies exhibit significant normal stress differences, which increase close to the substrate.},

abstract = {Output encoding often leads to superior accuracies in vari- ous machine learning tasks. In this paper we look at a signif- icant task of cell detection/localization from microscopy im- ages as a test case for output encoding. Since the output space is sparse for the cell detection problem (only a few pixel loca- tions are cell centers), we employ compressed sensing (CS)- based output encoding here. Using random projections, CS converts the sparse, output pixel space into dense and short (i.e., compressed) vectors. As a regressor, we use deep convo- lutional neural net (CNN) to predict the compressed vectors. Then applying a L1-norm recovery algorithm to the predicted vectors, we recover sparse cell locations in the output pixel space.We demonstrate CS-based output encoding provides us with the opportunity to do ensemble averaging to boost detec- tion/localization scores. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed CNN + CS framework (referred to as CNNCS) is competitive or better than the the state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets for microscopy cell detection. In the AMIDA13 MICCAI grand competition, we achieve the 3rd highest F1-score in all the 17 participated teams.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Low-voltage zones (LVZs) represent fibrotic tissue and are substrates for atrial fibrillation (AF). We hypothesized that LVZ-based substrate modification along with pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) would improve outcomes in persistent AF (PeAF) patients with LVZs, whereas PVI alone would work in patients without LVZs. METHODS AND RESULTS Voltage mapping of the left atrium (LA) was performed during sinus rhythm in 101 PeAF patients in whom LVZ was defined as an area with bipolar electrograms {\textless}0.5 mV. Thirty-nine patients had LVZs and underwent ablation of the entire LVZ area after PVI (LVZabl group). In remaining 62 patients without LVZs, PVI alone was performed with no further substrate modifications (PVI group). An additional group of 16 consecutive PeAF patients with LVZ did not undergo any substrate modification after PVI and was used as a comparison group (LVZnon-abl group) despite having similar size of LVZs to that in the LVZabl group. After a single session, 28 (72{\%}) patients in the LVZabl group had no recurrence, whereas 49 (79{\%}) patients in the PVI group had no recurrence during 18 ± 7 months of follow-up (log-rank p = 0.400). In the LVZnon-abl group, only 6 patients (38{\%}) had no recurrence during 32 ± 7 months of follow-up, even after a mean number of sessions of 1.8 (log-rank, p {\textless} 0.001, compared with the LVZabl group). CONCLUSIONS Additional LVZ-based substrate modification after PVI improved the outcome in PeAF patients with LVZs, whereas PVI alone worked in patients without LVZs, even in those with PeAF.

abstract = {The fluvial riparian and aquatic patch mosaic varies along rivers according to geomorphological setting, hydrological regime, sediment supply and surface-groundwater connectivity. This relation between physical processes and plants is not unidirectional. Once established, riparian and aquatic plants frequently act as physical ecosystem engineers by trapping and stabilising sediments, organic matter and the propagules of other plant species, modifying the local sedimentary and morphological environment by driving the development of landforms and associated habitats, and so facilitating the rapid establishment of other plants that can in turn reinforce the development of landforms such as river banks, vegetated islands and floodplains. This paper reviews knowledge on the hydrogeomorphological significance of riparian and aquatic vegetation with a particular emphasis on humid temperate, mixed load, gravel bed, floodplain rivers.First, we investigate how vegetation dynamics across river margins are governed by hydrological processes that can both promote riparian vegetation growth and disturb and destroy riparian and aquatic vegetation. We show, with some simple numerical modeling, that different combinations of moisture supply and flow disturbance have the potential to generate many different responses in the lateral distribution of vegetation biomass along river corridors.Second, building on the varied lateral biomass distributions that are primarily dictated by hydrological processes, we review research evaluating characteristic vegetation-mediated landform development. We investigate aquatic and riparian plants acting as physical ecosystem engineers by creating and modifying habitats in river systems with sufficient suspended sediment supply for habitat or landform building. These plants have a crucial impact on sediment stabilisation and pioneer landform building along the interface between plant (resistance) dominated and fluvial-disturbance (force) dominated zones of the river corridor. We present some examples of vegetation-mediated landforms along rivers with strongly contrasting hydrological regimes and thus lateral distributions of vegetation.Lastly, we present a conceptual synthetic model that links the development of pioneer landforms by engineering plants with river morphology and morphodynamics in humid temperate, mixed load, gravel bed, floodplain rivers. Drawing on four example rivers, we show how different plants and pioneer landforms act at the interface between the plant dominated and fluvial-disturbance dominated zones of the river corridor as river energy and vegetation colonisation and growth change. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {By trapping sediment in reservoirs, dams interrupt the continuity of sediment transport through rivers, resulting in loss of reservoir storage and reduced usable life, and depriving downstream reaches of sediments essential for channel form and aquatic habitats. With the acceleration of new dam construction globally, these impacts are increasingly widespread. There are proven techniques to pass sediment through or around reservoirs, to preserve reservoir capacity and to minimize downstream impacts, but they are not applied in many situations where they would be effective. This paper summarizes collective experience from five continents in managing reservoir sediments and mitigating downstream sediment starvation. Where geometry is favorable it is often possible to bypass sediment around the reservoir, which avoids reservoir sedimentation and supplies sediment to downstream reaches with rates and timing similar to pre-dam conditions. Sluicing (or drawdown routing) permits sediment to be transported through the reservoir rapidly to avoid sedimentation during high flows; it requires relatively large capacity outlets. Drawdown flushing involves scouring and re-suspending sediment deposited in the reservoir and transporting it downstream through low-level gates in the dam; it works best in narrow reservoirs with steep longitudinal gradients and with flow velocities maintained above the threshold to transport sediment. Turbidity currents can often be vented through the dam, with the advantage that the reservoir need not be drawn down to pass sediment. In planning dams, we recommend that these sediment management approaches be utilized where possible to sustain reservoir capacity and minimize environmental impacts of dams.},

abstract = {It has been known for a long time that sediment transport rates can vary strongly even if the ambient hydraulic conditions remain steady. In this article, a new approach is described to derive probability distributions of bed load transport rates, starting from the waiting time between the arrivals of individual sediment particles. The formalism should be valid when transport is not dominated by bed form motion. Without any assumptions about the distribution of interarrival times, the approach yields the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution, a two-parameter distribution previously used in lifetime modeling. Observed dependence of mean transport rates on the sampling time and multiscaling are predicted by the distribution. Assuming exponentially and Poisson-distributed interarrival times, the same approach yields the Poisson and the gamma distributions. Using a high-resolution bed load transport data set from the Pitzbach, Austria, the distribution functions are tested on field data. The gamma distribution best describes the data, with maximum deviations of ∼5{\%}. However, the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution may be more useful in certain applications, as it is a general approximation in the proposed formalism and no debated assumptions are necessary for its derivation.

abstract = {Gravel bed rivers commonly form an armored surface layer within which cluster bedforms develop. Clusters can form in isolation or develop cluster groups of increasing density. Flume experiments are presented in which a clustered, armored surface was formed on a gravel bed. Flows were measured over an area without a cluster and areas with an isolated cluster, a coupling of two clusters, and a group of three clusters. Turbulent flow parameters, Reynolds stresses, and turbulent kinetic energy were calculated from acoustic Doppler velocimeter measured flows and visualizations of the flow patterns around clusters. Flow separated over the cluster crest, creating an increase in the turbulent flow properties and a high-turbulence intensity region when flow reattached downstream. Turbulent kinetic energy increased around the coupled clusters, but around the grouped clusters, the flow field was distinguished by a high degree of uniformity. The net effect of increasing density of cluster grouping was an increase in the magnitude and variability of the turbulent flow field around coupled clusters, followed by an overall dampening of turbulent flows around grouped clusters in which the flow patterns generated interfered with one another, and the cluster forms sheltered the bed surface.

abstract = {Desert ephemeral gravel bed streams typically have bed surfaces that are relatively unarmored compared to the substrate below, while gravel bed streams in humid and snowmelt areas typically have well-armored surfaces. The degree of armoring can be characterized in terms of an armor ratio defined as the ratio of the surface median size to the substrate median size. A set of field data shows desert ephemeral gravel bed streams with armor ratios ranging from 0.5 to 2.4 and with an average value of 1.2. The armor ratio of snowmelt-fed gravel bed streams in the same set ranges from 2 to 7, with an average value of 3.4. The reason for this difference is sought in terms of differing hydrological characteristics and sediment supply regimes. Thirteen experiments were conducted to study the formation of armoring under a range of hydrological conditions. The experiments have two limiting cases: a relatively flat hydrograph that represents conditions produced by continuous snowmelt and a sharply peaked hydrograph that represents conditions associated with flash floods. All constant hydrograph experiments developed a well-armored structured surface, while short asymmetrical hydrographs did not result in substantial vertical sorting. All symmetrical hydrographs show some degree of sorting, and the sorting tended to become more pronounced with longer duration. Sediment supply appears to be a first-order control on bed surface armoring, while the shape of the hydrograph plays a secondary role. Copyright 2006 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {The evolution of gravel bed rivers under cycled hydrographs and constant sediment supply is studied in this paper. With the aid of numerical modeling and flume experiments, previous research has indicated that under such water and sediment supply conditions, a river can reach a mobile-bed equilibrium characterized by a hydrograph boundary layer (HBL) located near the upstream end of the river. The HBL defines the spatial region within which riverbed topography and grain size respond to the hydrograph, and downstream of which these bed characteristics are invariant. However, neither the governing physical mechanisms nor the general applicability of the HBL is yet well understood. In this paper, we implement a 1-D morphodynamic model for this problem. The model is first validated with data for both flume experiments and numerical simulations. It is then implemented at field scale with grain size distributions varying from uniform sediment to very poorly sorted sediment mixtures. Our results show that the idea of an HBL is applicable in the case of uniform sediment, but breaks down in the case of poorly sorted sediment mixtures. In such cases, persistent low-amplitude bed load sheets emerge along the entire channel reach, in addition to HBL-like upstream boundary effects. Bed load sheets can be described as surface texture or grain size sorting waves in consonance with low-amplitude elevation variations, and are ascribed to nonlinear advection terms in the governing equations that vanish for uniform sediment, but become significant when sediment is very poorly sorted.},

abstract = {A new approach for the profiling of movable sediment beds in laboratory experiments is presented. It couples a triangulation laser sensor and an ultrasonic level transmitter, and allows a non-intrusive, fast and accurate measurement of bed topography without stopping the experimental runs. The distortion of the laser beam due to the refraction at the water surface is corrected by contemporaneously measuring the elevation of the water surface through the ultrasonic level transmitter and taking advantage of geometrical relations involving the water depth, distance of the sensors from the water surface, and the angles that the emitted laser beam forms with the vertical before and after refraction. Several tests, under either still- or flowing-water conditions, as well as increasing/decreasing water surface elevation, were carried out to evaluate the accuracy of the measurements. These tests indicate that good-quality measurements are obtained for flow depths in the range 0{\textless}D{\textless}60 mm, typical of morphodynamic laboratory experiments.

abstract = {The population dynamics of two interacting species modeled by the Lotka-Volterra (LV) model with general parameters that can promote or suppress the other species is studied. It is found that the properties of the two species' isoclines determine the interaction of species, leading to six regimes in the phase diagram of interspecies interaction; i.e., there are six different interspecific relationships described by the LV model. Four regimes allow for nontrivial species coexistence, among which it is found that three of them are stable, namely, weak competition, mutualism, and predator-prey scenarios can lead to win-win coexistence situations. The Lyapunov function for general nontrivial two-species coexistence is also constructed. Furthermore, in the presence of spatial diffusion of the species, the dynamics can lead to steady wavefront propagation and can alter the population map. Propagating wavefront solutions in one dimension are investigated analytically and by numerical solutions. The steady wavefront speeds are obtained analytically via nonlinear dynamics analysis and verified by numerical solutions. In addition to the inter- and intraspecific interaction parameters, the intrinsic speed parameters of each species play a decisive role in species populations and wave properties. In some regimes, both species can copropagate with the same wave speeds in a finite range of parameters. Our results are further discussed in the light of possible biological relevance and ecological implications.},

Though it scales linearly with the number of particles, there has been a constant interest in increasing its performance, because a large part of CPU time is spent to identify the interacting particles. Several recent publications proposed improvements to the algorithm and investigated their efficiency by applying them to particular setups. Here we develop a general method to evaluate the efficiency of these algorithms which is mostly independent of the parameters of the simulation, and test it for a number of linked cell algorithms.

Starting from Einstein's theory, the approach was obtained by trying to overcome some of the intrinsic limitations. The approach is based on two distinct probability functions, one relevant to the detachment of grains and the second relevant to the length of particle jumps. The sediment transport rate is obtained by integrating the distribution of the ranges of the particle jumps multiplied by the average particle velocity. The relationship for the average ranges of particle jumps is an opportune combination of the Einstein and Yalin expressions. The final formulation was calibrated by means of a large number of experimental data and also by comparison with some of the most widely-used empirical formulas. The results show a better agreement between theory and experiments than do the other theories analyzed.},

abstract = {We present a new random walk model for bed load sediment transport that explains the scale-dependency generally observed in transport rates and captures the transient anomalous dispersion often seen in rivers. Particles alternate between mobile and resting phases, with a tempered stable probability distribution for both particle step length and resting time. Tempered fractional mobile-immobile differential equations model the ensemble average of particle dynamics. The model is tested against data from three sediment dispersion experiments. Using tempering in both space and time, the new model is able to capture the full range of observed ensemble particle dynamics. The random walk model illuminates the physical meaning of all transport parameters in the mobile-immobile equations and explains transitions between observed super-diffusive, sub-diffusive, and regular diffusive ensemble particle dynamics. By explicitly predicting the effects of spatial and temporal averaging on particle dynamics, this method can be used to link observations of fluvial sediment dynamics across scales. This approach is also generally applicable to a wide variety of geophysical and ecological dynamics, such as ecological dispersal, pathogen transmission in rivers, nutrient export from watersheds, and large-scale geomorphodynamics associated with infrequent phenomena such as avalanches and turbidity currents. {\textcopyright} 2012.

@article{Lisle1992,
abstract = {Recent advances in our understanding of the origin and function of armouring in gravel-bed rivers have not addressed the role of non-uniformity and unsteadiness of flow. These flow attributes have important influences on both the surface and subsurface bed material size distributions which are observed at low flow, from which we commonly make inferences concerning bedload transport at high flow. Bed armouring, measured as the ratio of surface to subsurface bed material grain size, is highly variable spatially in a channel in which past and present bed aggradation indicates that the sediment supply has exceeded the transport capacity. Alternate bar topography induces strong variations in boundary shear stress, especially at low flow. The resulting winnowing of fine sediment from zones of high stress, such as riffles, and its deposition as thin sheets in zones of low stress, such as pools, produce wide variations in armouring. Linked winnowing and deposition of fine sediment in each bar pool sequence creates pronounced, local, streamwise sorting by grain size. Streamwise sorting can lead to pronounced apparent size-selectivity in bedload transport during subsequent rising stages. The relatively fine bedload transported during initial rising stages can originate from unarmoured deposits of fines, where all particle sizes present on the bed surface may be nearly equally mobile. These surfaces are devoid of larger particles, however, that appear in the bedload only when coarser armoured surfaces become more widely entrained. 13.1},

Their stabilization mechanism is attributed to a combined influence of the bistability between the bare state and the uniformly vegetation state, and Lorentzian-like nonlocal coupling that models the competition between plants. We show how a circular shape is formed, and how the aridity level influences the size of fairy circles. Finally, we show that the proposed mechanism is model-independent.},

Because these two flows are not the same, we first tested that the basic turbulence statistics for this velocity field did not differ significantly from those in an open-channel flow. We then tracked particles with a 3D Lagrangian model. The Lagrangian model also includes the calculation of the particle rotation and a generalized algorithm for particle collisions with walls and with other par- ticles. Numerical simulations of several particle sizes were performed and the results were compared with previous experimental data, with good agreement.},

abstract = {We present a study on the effects of particle shape (disks, hexagons, and pentagons) on the macroscopic coefficient of friction of a two-dimensional, monodisperse, single-shaped, granular system, subjected to shear. We found that the mechanism of stress relaxation in disks is based on the sliding of adjacent planes parallel to the applied deformation direction. In hexagons, stress is relaxed through the creation of rigid pivots, which require hexagonal domains to nucleate and are responsible for the large fluctuations in the dilatancy and shear force. In pentagons the stress relaxation mechanism is through the rotation of individual pentagons, which is a consequence of their permanent misalignment, and are responsible for the small but relatively rapid fluctuations in the shear force. We observed that the friction coefficient is larger for polygonal particles than for the rounded ones. A maximum in the friction coefficient is observed in hexagon granulates with an initial width around 6.5 grains caused by the increased frequency in nucleation of rigid pivots. In mixtures of disks and hexagons we observed three different friction coefficient behaviors, which depended on the relative concentration of hexagons; in low concentrations of hexagons, {\textless}20{\%}, the friction coefficient corresponds to that obtained in solely disks, at intermediate concentrations, {\textless}80{\%}, the coefficient varies linearly with concentration, and at larger concentrations the friction coefficient corresponds to the values obtained for solely hexagons. On the contrary, mixtures of pentagons and hexagons showed two regimes; a low constant friction regime at concentrations lower than 60{\%}, and an increased in friction observed with higher concentrations of hexagons.},

abstract = {Discrete element modeling (DEM) coupled with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) provides an excellent platform to analyze fluid-particle systems. In all previous work, the fluid and particle systems are solved on a single grid. Contradictory requirements posed by resolution of fine scale fluid features such as turbulence, friction and heat transfer coefficient at immersed surfaces, and the resolution of important geometrical features, versus the necessity to maintain smoothness in particle solid fraction distribution on the chosen grid, often make single grid calculations untenable. To overcome this challenge, we have developed a novel two-grid technique in which a coarser particle grid is mapped on to a fine fluid grid. The technique uses suitable mappings to transfer fluid field variables from fluid-to-particle grid, and interphase transfer terms and void fractions from particle-to-fluid grid. The method is applied to a jetting fluidized bed of 750$\mu$m particles with a characteristic jet width of 1.6. mm. Results in the form of time-averaged void fractions and solid-velocity for two inlet jet velocities with single and multiple jets are compared to experiments. The results agree reasonably well with the experiments validating the two-grid approach for cases where single grid DEM-CFD would have been difficult to apply. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

We combine the theory of random fields for spherical topology with a Fourier-shape-descriptor based method for the particle generation, and develop rigorous solutions to resolve the mathematical difficulties arising from the linking of the two. The generated particles are then packed within a prescribed container by a cell-filling algorithm based on Constrained Voronoi Tessellation. We employ two examples to demonstrate the excellent control and flexibility that the proposed method can offer in reproducing such key characteristics as shape descriptors (aspect ratio, roundness, sphericity, presence of facets, etc.), size distribution and solid fraction.

Longevities of extant "censored" species are truncated and thus do not statistically represent the underlying distribution. The remaining "uncensored" species do not represent the true relative abundances of longevities. These biases can be defined from the probability densities for species longevity s and interval r between successive originations of species. For realistic densities of s and r, species with an intermediate longevity are preferentially censored. This simple, general result arises because the probability of censoring a species increases with its longevity, whereas the probability of censoring a given longevity varies with its relative abundance. {\textcopyright} 1990 International Association for Mathematical Geology.},

abstract = {The illumination of single population behaviour subject to the processes of birth, death and immigration has provided a basis for the discussion of the non-Gaussian statistical and temporal correlation properties of scattered radiation. As a first step towards the modelling of its spatial correlations, we consider the populations supported by an infinite chain of discrete sites, each subject to birth, death and immigration and coupled by migration between adjacent sites. To provide some motivation, and illustrate the techniques we will use, the migration process for a single particle on an infinite chain of sites is introduced and its diffusion dynamics derived. A certain continuum limit is identified and its properties studied via asymptotic analysis. This forms the basis of the multi-particle model of a coupled population subject to single site birth, death and immigration processes, in addition to inter-site migration. A discrete rate equation is formulated and its generating function dynamics derived. This facilitates derivation of the equations of motion for the first- and second-order cumulants, thus generalizing the earlier results of Bailey through the incorporation of immigration at each site. We present a novel matrix formalism operating in the time domain that enables solution of these equations yielding the mean occupancy and inter-site variances in the closed form. The results for the first two moments at a single time are used to derive expressions for the asymptotic time-delayed correlation functions, which relates to Glauber's analysis of an Ising model. The paper concludes with an analysis of the continuum limit of the birth-death-immigration-migration process in terms of a path integral formalism. The continuum rate equation and evolution equation for the generating function are developed, from which the evolution equation of the mean occupancy is derived, in this limit. Its solution is provided in closed form. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the two-dimensional rolling motion of a single large particle in a shallow water stream down a steep rough bed from both an experimental and a theoretical point of view. The experiment is prototypal of sediment transport on sloping beds. Two theoretical models are presented. The first model uses the mean kinetic energy balance to deduce the average particle velocity and the bounds of the flow-rate range within which a rolling regime occurs. This range is found to be narrow, which means that the fully rolling regime is a marginal mode of transport between repose and saltation. In the second model, the particle state (resting, rolling, saltating) is considered as a random variable, whose evolution constitutes a jump Markov chain. This makes it possible to deduce the mean particle velocity as a function of the flow conditions without explicit mention of its state. The theoretical results are finally compared to the experimental data. The second model provides correct estimates of the particle velocity and the probability of finding the particle in a given state for various flow conditions (bead material, slope, and roughness). {\textcopyright} 2003 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {We derive a closed master equation for an individual-based population model in continuous space and time. The model and master equation include Brownian motion, reproduction via binary fission, and an interaction-dependent death rate moderated by a competition kernel. Using simulations we compare this individual-based model with the simplest approximation, the spatial logistic equation. In the limit of strong diffusion the spatial logistic equation is a good approximation to the model. However, in the limit of weak diffusion the spatial logistic equation is inaccurate because of spontaneous clustering driven by reproduction. The weak-diffusion limit can be partially analyzed using an exact solution of the master equation applicable to a competition kernel with infinite range. This analysis shows that in the case of a top-hat kernel, reducing the diffusion can increase the total population. For a Gaussian kernel, reduced diffusion invariably reduces the total population. These theoretical results are confirmed by simulation. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {To date, there is no consensus on the probability distribution of particle velocities during bedload transport, with some studies suggesting an exponential-like distribution while others a Gaussian-like distribution. Yet, the form of this distribution is key for the determination of sediment flux and the dispersion characteristics of tracers in rivers. Combining theoretical analysis of the Fokker-Planck equation for particle motions, numerical simulations of the corresponding Langevin equation, and measurements of motion in high-speed imagery from particle-tracking experiments, we examine the statistics of bedload particle trajectories, revealing a two-regime distance-time (L-Tp) scaling for the particle hops (measured from start to stop). We show that particles of short hop distances scale as L {\~{}} T2p giving rise to the Weibull-like front of the hop distance distribution, while particles of long hop distances transition to a different scaling regime of L {\~{}} Tp leading to the exponential-like tail of the hop distance distribution. By demonstrating that the predominance of mostly long hop particles results in a Gaussian-like velocity distribution, while a mixture of both short and long hop distance particles leads to an exponential-like velocity distribution, we argue that the form of the probability distribution of particle velocities can depend on the physical environment within which particle transport occurs, explaining and unifying disparate views on particle velocity statistics reported in the literature.},

abstract = {The aim of this investigation was to experimentally examine the surface pressures and resulting forces on an individual sediment grain whose size is comparable to the scales of the turbulent channel flow in an effort to discern details of the flow/grain interaction. This was accomplished by measuring the pressure fluctuations on the surface of a coarse, fully exposed, spherical grain resting upon a bed of identical grains in open channel turbulent flow. This spherical particle was instrumented with low-range, high-frequency-response pressure transducers to measure the individual surface pressures simultaneously on its front, back, top and bottom. The local flow velocity was measured synchronously with a laser Doppler velocimeter. The flow and sediment are near threshold conditions for entrainment with the channel and particle Reynolds numbers varying between 31 000-39 000 and 330-440 respectively. The emphasis was on determining the characteristics of the flow field with the potential to dislodge a spherical grain under uniform flow conditions as well as in the wake of a circular cylinder placed spanwise across the flow in otherwise fully developed open channel flow. It is concluded that the streamwise velocity near the bed is most directly related to those force events (and associated individual surface pressure distributions) crucial for particle entrainment. The lift force was observed to momentarily reach values which can be consequential for particle stability, although it is poorly correlated with the fluctuating normal velocity component. Turbulence intensity near the bed, rather than being the causative factor for increased force fluctuations, was shown to be an indicator of changes in the average lift force experienced by the grain during the application of extreme drag forces, at least for this particular flow condition (the upstream, spanwise-mounted circular cylinder). This effect is known to alter the sediment transport rates significantly. The characteristics of the temporal durations of flow events about the local maxima in the stagnation pressure, drag and lift forces, using a conditional sampling method, revealed the prevalence of sweep-type near-bed flow events in generating favourable conditions for particle dislodgement, although the dominant feature is the positive streamwise velocity fluctuation, not the normal velocity component. The duration of such events was the highest in the fourth and first quadrants in the u,w plane, inducing high impulses on the grain. {\textcopyright} 2014 Cambridge University Press.},

Flume experiments show that the leading front of bed-load on a 20-m-long, mixed-size gravel-bed moves anomalously, where the transient transport rate of the accelerating front varies with the observation time scale. In addition, observations show that moving particles may experience bimodal transport (i.e., coexistence of long trapping time and large jump length) related to bed coarsening and the formation of clusters on a heterogeneous gravel-bed, which is distinguished from the traditional theory of hiding-exposing interactions among mixed-size particles. A fractional derivative model is finally applied to characterize the overall behavior of partial bed-load transport, including the coexistence of the sub-diffusion and non-local feature caused by turbulence and the micro-relief within an armor layer.},

abstract = {We present a systematic numerical investigation of the shear strength and structure of granular packings composed of irregular polyhedral particles. The angularity of the particles is varied by increasing the number of faces from 8 (octahedronlike shape) to 596. We find that the shear strength increases with angularity up to a maximum value and saturates as the particles become more angular (below 46 faces). At the same time, the packing fraction increases to a peak value but declines for more angular particles. We analyze the connectivity and anisotropy of the microstructure by considering both the contacts and branch vectors joining particle centers. The increase of the shear strength with angularity is shown to be due to a net increase of the fabric and force anisotropies but at higher particle angularity a rapid falloff of the fabric anisotropy is compensated by an increase of force anisotropy, leading thus to the saturation of shear strength. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

Among the various mechanisms proposed for explaining this variability, bedform migration is often cited as the main cause. We took a closer look at this issue by running long-duration experiments in a gravel bed flume using constant water discharge and sediment feed rates. We monitored bed evolution and measured bedload transport rates at the flume outlet using high-resolution techniques. The bed was initially flat, but within a few hours bedforms consisting of alternate bars and pools had developed. The bars exhibited a stick-slip motion: they were stable for long periods but moved episodically (every 10 hr on average). Their downstream migration produced 36{\%} of the sediment volume transported, mostly in the form of intense pulses. Much of the transport was caused by the displacement of sediment waves from pool to pool.},

abstract = {A bed load transport model based on the mechanics of sediment moving by saltation yields predicted values of bed load flux as a function of boundary shear stress, grain diameter and density. The parameters required to calculate bed load transport (particle velocity, bed load sediment concentration, and the height of the bed load layer) can all be determined from our model, which computes sequences of trajectories of individual saltating grains as well as the concentration of moving grains that the flow can support. The latter is related to the momentum the accelerating grains extract from the flow. Predicted curves of bed load transport vs. boundary shear stress agree well with transport data collected by Gilbert, Meyer-Peter et al., and the Waterways Experimental Station; measured shear stress was corrected for pressure drag when bed forms were present. Comparison of predicted bed load transport with common bed load equations reveals considerable similarity among the relationships. The best agreement with the data is produced by relationships in which the transport rate vanishes as the shear stress approaches the critical Shields' number, as in our model and Yalin's equation. {\textcopyright} ASCE.},

abstract = {The morphology of an alluvial river channel affects the movement of water and sediment along it, but in the longer run is shaped by those processes. This interplay has mostly been investigated empirically within the paradigm of Newtonian mechanics. In rivers, this has created an emphasis on equilibrium configurations with simple morphology and uniform steady flow. But transient adjustment, whether between equilibrium states or indefinitely, is to be expected in a world in which hydrology, sediment supply, and base level are not fixed. More fundamentally, water flows and all the phenomena that accompany them are inherently unsteady, and flows in natural channels are characteristically nonuniform. The morphodynamics of alluvial river channels is the striking consequence. In this paper, we develop the essential connection between the episodic nature of bed material transport and the production of river morphology, emphasizing the fundamental problems of sediment transport, the role of bar evolution in determining channel form, the role of riparian vegetation, and the wide range of time scales for change. As the key integrative exercise, we emphasize the importance of physics-based modeling of morphodynamics. We note consequences that can be of benefit to society if properly understood. These include the possibility to better be able to model how varying flows drive morphodynamic change, to understand the influence of the sediments themselves on morphodynamics, and to recognize the inherent necessity for rivers that transport bed material to deform laterally. We acknowledge pioneering contributions in WRR and elsewhere that have introduced some of these themes.},

@article{Papanicolaou2018,
abstract = {The influence of boulders in high gradient gravel-bed rivers can be significant. Yet few studies have isolated their role in regulating bedload. It is hypothesized that boulder relative submergence and the corresponding eddies developing around boulders affect the frequency of bedload pulsations and the location of sediment deposits. Results show the occurrence of two distinct timescales in bedload exiting a boulder array, which were identified via time series analysis. These are the small-scale periodicity, PS, and the large-scale periodicity, PL. PS was identified in the range of 4–6 min and is believed to result from congested bedload movement due to reduced conveyance area within the array. PL was identified in the range of 8–46 min. It is suggested that PL corresponds to large bedload releases around boulders, which the authors consider to be caused by feedbacks between boulder eddies and bedload deposits. It is also found that boulder submergence and Froude number, Fr, influence the location of predominant deposition. At High Relative Submergence, deposition occurs in the boulder wake regions. At Low Relative Submergence, deposition instead occurs upstream of boulders in locations that depend on Fr. For Fr {\textless} 1, material deposits in the stoss of boulders due to the necklace structure of the horseshoe vortex. However, for Fr {\textgreater} 1, material deposits at the flanks of boulders due to the influence of local wave crests around boulders. The trapping efficiency of boulders reduces the dimensionless mean bedload transport rate by three orders of magnitude compared to conditions without boulders.},

abstract = {The process of burial and exhumation of bedload particles within a certain depth of the riverbed leads to vertical exchange of particles, which significantly affects the characteristics of streamwise bedload transport. In this paper, we revisit the classic active layer formulation and extend it by incorporating the burial and exhumation through conceptualizing the fluctuations of bed surface as the relative vertical movement of buried tracer particles in the substrate layer (i.e., we change the static reference system to the fluctuating riverbed surface). We theoretically demonstrate, for the first time, the emergence of the transient anomalous diffusion (both superdiffusion and subdiffusion) and power-law advective slowdown at the intermediate timescales, which are induced by the nonequilibrium transport as characterized by the inhomogeneous vertical mixing of tracers due to particle burial and exhumation. Neglecting the ballistic regime at extremely short times, at small and large timescales, the transport regimes show normal diffusion. This result further implies that for the most typical fluvial riverbed with finite vertical exchange depth (i.e. nonaggrading or nondegrading bed), the subdiffusion of bedload tracers for large timescale transport may still be transient, which will eventually converge to the normal diffusion as time increases. Comparing the obtained analytical solutions with available numerical results as well as field observations, we show that the proposed formulation can capture well anomalous diffusion and the power-law slowdown of the advective velocity of bedload tracers at intermediate timescales, and more importantly the transition from anomalous to normal diffusion at large timescales.},

Synthetic methods, originating from analytical approximation to homogeneous isotropic turbulence, have branched out into several robust methods, including the synthetic random Fourier method, synthetic digital filtering method, synthetic coherent eddy method, and synthetic volume forcing method. This article reviews major progress in inflow turbulence generation methods with an emphasis on fundamental ideas, key milestones, representative applications, and critical issues. Directions for future research in the field are also highlighted.},

The RD model can generate a wide variety of spatial patterns, and mathematical studies have revealed the kinds of interactions required for each, giving this model the potential for application as an experimental working hypothesis in a wide variety of morphological phenomena. In this review, we describe the essence of this theory for experimental biologists unfamiliar with the model, using examples from experimental studies in which the RD model is effectively incorporated.},

abstract = {A minimal Lagrangian two-phase model to study turbulent bedload transport focusing on the granular phase is presented and validated with experiments. The model intends to describe bedload transport of massive particles in fully rough flows at relatively low Shields numbers, for which no suspension occurs. A discrete element method for the granular phase is coupled with a one dimensional volume-averaged two-phase momentum equation for the fluid phase. The coupling between the discrete granular phase and the continuous fluid phase is discussed, and a consistent averaging formulation adapted to bedload transport is introduced. An original simple discrete random walk model is proposed to account for the fluid velocity fluctuations. The model is compared with experiments considering both classical sediment transport rate as a function of the Shields number, and depth profiles of solid velocity, volume fraction, and transport rate density, from existing bedload transport experiments in inclined flume. The results successfully reproduce the classical 3/2 power law, and more importantly describe well the depth profiles of the granular phase, showing that the model is able to reproduce the particle scale mechanisms. From a sensitivity analysis, it is shown that the fluctuation model allows to reproduce a realistic critical Shields number, and that the influence of the granular parameters on the macroscopic results is weak. Nevertheless, the analysis of the corresponding depth profiles reveals an evolution of the depth structure of the granular phase with varying restitution and friction coefficients, which denotes the non-trivial underlying physical mechanisms.},

abstract = {The stochastic nature of bed load transport induces diffusion of sediment tracers, which is governed by the dynamics of their bulk behavior over time. By deploying both numerical simulations and flume experiments, the emergent particle diffusion regimes for both uniform and mixed tracer particles were studied and compared. For uniform particles, power-law-distributed resting times Tr produced super-, sub- or normal diffusion regimes for certain values of the tail exponent $\nu$. Based on the assumption that heterogeneity in particle size leads to a power-law distribution of Tr, a completely different diffusion regime emerges in mixtures compared with those obtained from uniform particles with the same value of the tail exponent $\nu$. Mixtures exhibited the same ballistic regime (the variance of travel distance grows as time squared) for different values of $\nu$, and ballistic regimes for mixtures also emerged from several other tested models. Furthermore, our experimental results confirmed the ballistic regime; however, the decreasing number of tracked particles may result in apparent but deceptive sub-diffusion. We conclude that ballistic regimes for mixtures result from violations of the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumptions, attributing to downstream sorting processes.},

A simple model of plant and water dynamics based on ecologically realistic assumptions and with reasonable parameter values captures both of these types of patterns. The regular patterns result from a Turing-like instability; the irregular patterns arise when the ecological dynamics amplify slight small- scale topographic variability. Because of the dose agreement between observations and these theoretical results, this system provides a dear example of how nonlinear mechanisms can be important in determining the spatial structure of plant communities.},

abstract = {Riparian vegetation can significantly influence the morphology of a river, affecting channel geometry and flow dynamics. To examine the effects of riparian vegetation on gravel bed braided streams, we conducted a series of physical experiments at the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory with varying densities of bar and bank vegetation. Water discharge, sediment discharge, and grain size were held constant between runs. For each run, we allowed a braided system to develop, then seeded the flume with alfalfa (Medicago sativa), allowed the seeds to grow, and then continued the run. We collected data on water depth, surface velocity, and bed elevation throughout each run using image-based techniques designed to collect data over a large spatial area with minimal disturbance to the flow. Our results show that the influence of vegetation on overall river patterns varied systematically with the spatial density of plant stems. Vegetation reduced the number of active channels and increased bank stability, leading to lower lateral migration rates, narrower and deeper channels, and increased channel relief. These effects increased with vegetation density. Vegetation influenced flow dynamics, increasing the variance of flow direction in vegetated runs and increasing scour depths through strong downwelling where the flow collided with relatively resistant banks. This oblique bank collision also provides a new mechanism for producing secondary flows. We found it to be more important than the classical curvature-driven mechanism in vegetated runs.},

abstract = {Alluvial mountain streams exhibit a range of channel forms: pool-riffle, plane bed, step-pool and cascades. Previous work suggested that these forms exist within discrete, and progressively steeper slope classes. Measurements conducted at over 100 sites in west-central and central Idaho confirm that slope steepens progressively as one moves from pool-riffle, to plane bed, to step-pool, and finally to cascades. Median slope for pool-riffle topography is 0{\textperiodcentered}0060, for plane beds 0{\textperiodcentered}013, for step-pools 0{\textperiodcentered}044, and for cascades 0{\textperiodcentered}068. There is substantial overlap in the slopes associated with these channel forms. Pool-riffle topography was found at slopes between 0{\textperiodcentered}0010 and 0{\textperiodcentered}015, plane beds between 0{\textperiodcentered}0010 and 0{\textperiodcentered}035, step-pools between 0{\textperiodcentered}015 and 0{\textperiodcentered}134, and cascades between 0{\textperiodcentered}050 and 0{\textperiodcentered}12. Step-pools are particularly striking features in headwater streams. They are characterized by alternating steep and gentle channel segments. The steep segments (step risers) are transverse accumulations of boulder and cobbles, while the gentle segments (pools) contain finer material. Step wavelength is best correlated to step height which is in turn best correlated to the median particle size found on step risers. This result differs from past studies that have reported channel slope to be the dominant control on step wavelength. The presumed geometry and Froude number associated with the features under formative conditions are consistent with the existence field for antidunes and by extension with the hypothesis that step-pools are formed by antidunes.

abstract = {The performance is tested of 12 bed load sediment transport formulae developed for use in gravel bed channels. The formulae are applied in the manner intended by the original authors. To this end, the test data are restricted to ones obtained in approximately steady flow when the material in motion was similar to that present on the bed; that is, transport was not size selective. This represents the nearest approach to “equilibrium sediment transport” that can be realized with available data. Four sets of river data and three sets of flume data were chosen for the test, covering a range of eight orders of magnitude in unit bed load transport rate. The test data were not used in the development of the formulae. The analysis separates mean bias and local bias. No formula performs consistently well. Limitations of the test data, the constraints imposed by an operationally realistic test, and reasons based upon the physics of the transport phenomenon all may be adduced for this. To estimate the magnitude of transport with limited hydraulic information, stream power equations should be used because they provide the most straightforward scale correlation of the phenomenon. In particular, the approach of Bagnold deserves further study. When local hydraulic information is available, a formula should be selected that is sensitive to bed state or grain size distribution and, in this context, the formulae of Einstein, Parker, and Ackers‐White‐Day bear continued examination.

abstract = {We performed a series of numerical vertical compression tests on assemblies of 2D granular material using a Discrete Element code and studied the results with regard to the grain shape. The samples consist of 5000 grains made from either 3 overlapping discs (clumps - grains with concavities) or six-edged polygons (convex grains). These two grain type have similar external envelope, which is a function of a geometrical parameter $\alpha$. In this paper, the numerical procedure applied is briefly presented followed by the description of the granular model used. Observations and mechanical analysis of dense and loose granular assemblies under isotropic loading are made. The mechanical response of our numerical granular samples is studied in the framework of the classical vertical compression test with constant lateral stress (biaxial test). The comparison of macroscopic responses of dense and loose samples with various grain shapes shows that when $\alpha$ is considered a concavity parameter, it is therefore a relevant variable for increasing mechanical performances of dense samples. When $\alpha$ is considered an envelope deviation from perfect sphericity, it can control mechanical performances for large strains. Finally, we present some remarks concerning the kinematics of the deformed samples: while some polygon samples subjected to a vertical compression present large damage zones (any polygon shape), dense samples made of clumps always exhibit thin reflecting shear bands. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Pebble clusters are important morphological features of gravel-bed rivers and have a significant effect on the spatial and temporal response of the flow. This paper presents original results from measurements of velocity taken at a high spatial and temporal resolution in a turbulent flow upstream and downstream from a pebble cluster. Three electromagnetic current meters (0.013 m in diameter), mounted on a wading rod, were deployed upstream and downstream of an isolated pebble cluster along 31 vertical profiles that contained between 7 and 13 points in a 5-m long section. The high sampling resolutions in a natural environment permitted characterization of the complex dynamics of the turbulent flow in the vicinity of the cluster. The description of these dynamics is based on the interpretation of contour maps of several turbulence statistics, including moments of velocity distributions, Reynolds shear stress, quadrant analysis and autocorrelation function. Downstream from the cluster, flow is decelerated, the intensity of turbulence increases, and zones of strong vertical motions are present. The superimposition of the maps allowed us to decompose the field of turbulent flow around a pebble cluster into distinct regions. In a downstream direction from the cluster, we observed zones of flow acceleration, recirculation, vortex shedding, flow reattachment, fluid upwelling, and flow recovering. Results indicate the existence of highly dynamic boundaries between zones where strong intermittent events are generated. They also highlight the difference between shedding and upwelling motions of the flow.},

The morphology of large packings of elongated particles in quasistatic equilibrium is complex due to the combined effects of local nematic ordering of the particles and orientations of contacts between particles. The effect of elongation on shear behavior and dilatancy was investigated in detail in a previous paper. Here, we show how particle elongation affects force distributions and force-fabric anisotropy via various local structures allowed by steric exclusions and the requirement of force balance. We find that the force distributions become increasingly broader as particles become more elongated. Interestingly, the weak force network transforms from a passive stabilizing agent with respect to strong force chains to an active force-transmitting network for the whole system. The strongest force chains are carried by side-side contacts oriented along the principal stress direction. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},

The model CAST (Cellular Automaton Sediment Transport) contains phenomenological parameterizations, deterministic or stochastic, of sediment supply, bed load transport, and particle entrainment and deposition in a cellular-automaton space with uniform grain size. The model reproduces a realistic bed morphology and typical fluctuations in transport rates observed in steep channels. Particle hop distances, from entrainment to deposition, are well fitted by exponential distributions, in agreement with field data. The effect of stochasticity in both the entrainment and the input rate is shown. A stochastic parameterization of the entrainment is essential to create and maintain a realistic channel morphology, while the intermittent transport of grains in CAST shreds the input signal and its stochastic variability. A jamming routine has been added to CAST to simulate the grain-grain and grain-bed interactions that lead to particle jamming and step formation in a step-pool stream. The results show that jamming is effective in generating steps in unsteady conditions. Steps are created during high-flow periods and they survive during low flows only in sediment-starved conditions, in agreement with the jammed-state hypothesis of Church and Zimmermann (2007). Reduced-complexity models like CAST give new insights into the dynamics of complex phenomena such as sediment transport and bedform stability and are a useful complement to fully physically based models to test research hypotheses.},

On the basis of this model, we show that the vegetation stripes (tiger bush) formed by these communities result from an interplay between short-range cooperative interactions controlling plant reproduction and long-range self-inhibitory interactions originating from plant competition for environmental resources. Isotropic as well as anisotropic environmental conditions are discussed. We find that vegetation stripes tend to orient themselves in the direction parallel or perpendicular with respect to a direction of anisotropy depending on whether this anisotropy influences the interactions favouring or inhibiting plant reproduction; furthermore, we show that ground curvature is not a necessary condition for the appearance of arcuate vegetation patterns. In agreement with in situ observations, we find that the width of vegetated bands increases when environmental conditions get more arid and that patterns formed of stripes oriented parallel to the direction of a slope are static, while patterns which are perpendicular to this direction exhibit an upslope motion.},

abstract = {Sediment transport is studied as a function of the grain to fluid density ratio using two phase numerical simulations based on a discrete element method for particles coupled to a continuum Reynolds averaged description of hydrodynamics. At a density ratio close to unity (typically under water), vertical velocities are so small that sediment transport occurs in a thin layer at the surface of the static bed, and is called bed load. Steady, or "saturated" transport is reached when the fluid borne shear stress at the interface between the mobile grains and the static grains is reduced to its threshold value. The number of grains transported per unit surface is therefore limited by the flux of horizontal momentum towards the surface. However, the fluid velocity in the transport layer remains almost undisturbed so that the mean grain velocity scales with the shear velocity u*. At large density ratio (typically in air), the vertical velocities are large enough to make the transport layer wide and dilute. Sediment transport is then called saltation. In this case, particles are able to eject others when they collide with the granular bed, a process called splash. The number of grains transported per unit surface is selected by the balance between erosion and deposition, and saturation is reached when one grain is statistically replaced by exactly one grain after a collision, which has the consequence that the mean grain velocity remains independent of u*. The influence of the density ratio is systematically studied to reveal the transition between these two transport regimes. Based on the mechanisms identified in the steady case, we discuss the transient of saturation of sediment transport and, in particular, the saturation time and length. Finally, we investigate the exchange of particles between the mobile and static phases and we determine the exchange time of particles. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Institute of Physics.},

We elaborated on the foundations of our numerical method and validated it on assorted test cases. However, the implementation was serial and impeded to examine large systems. Here we extend our method to parallel computing using a classical domain decomposition approach and inter-domain MPI communication. The code is implemented in C++ for multi-CPU architecture. Although object-oriented C++ offers high-level programming concepts that enhance the versatility required to treat multi-shape and multi-size granular systems, particular care has to be devoted to memory management on multi-core architecture to achieve reasonable computing efficiency. The parallel performance of our code Grains3D is assessed on various granular flow configurations comprising both spherical and angular particles. We show that our parallel granular solver is able to compute systems with up to a few hundreds of millions of particles. This opens up new perspectives in the study of granular material dynamics.},

The model represents biological individuals that die or reproduce at rates depending on the number of neighbors within a given distance. We evaluate the importance of the discrete and fluctuating character of this particle model on the pattern-forming process. To this end, a deterministic mean-field description, including a linear stability and a weakly nonlinear analysis, is given and compared with the particle model. The deterministic approach is shown to reproduce some of the features of the discrete description, in particular, the existence of a finite-wavelength instability. Stochasticity in the particle dynamics, however, has strong effects in other important aspects such as the parameter values at which pattern formation occurs, or the nature of the homogeneous phase. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.

abstract = {It is common for mountain riverbeds to exhibit a repetitive pattern of topographic lows and highs known respectively as pools and riffles. Pool-riffle structures are ecologically important because salmon rely on them for birth, growth and regeneration, and they are physically important because pool-riffles are observed across diverse landscape settings. A common physical characteristic of pool-riffles is that pool spacing is proportional to channel width, for longitudinal bed slopes that vary by two-orders of magnitude. Furthermore, field, numerical and laboratory based studies observe that pools are colocated with points of channel narrowing, and riffles with points of widening. What is not known, however, is how downstream changes of channel width give rise to, and maintain pool-riffles. The goal of my thesis is to address this knowledge gap, and to specifically build physical understanding for the observed spatial correlation between channel width and pool-riffle architecture. I use field work, laboratory experiments and theory to address this goal. In Chapter 2 I apply non-parametric statistics and self-organizing maps to understand the spatial and temporal character of riffle bed surface texture spanning 11 different sediment mobilizing floods, and conclude that frequent texture adjustment is part of the maintenance process for pool-riffles which exhibit topographic stationarity. I build from this finding in Chapters 3, 4 and 5 with laboratory experiments designed to investigate how pool-riffles form and evolve along variable width channel reaches. In Chapter 4 I conclude that pool-riffle formation is physically driven by two competing timescales which reflect the tendency to build riverbed topography through sediment deposition, vs. the tendency to destroy topography through net particle entrainment. I capture these timescales in a mathematical model I develop using theory with physical scaling. In Chapter 5 I show that the (dis)equilibrium state of pool-riffle evolution is quantitatively described by a competition between two rates which reflect the temporal adjustment of riverbed topography and riverbed surface texture. I conclude that equilibrium, or comparability between the rates of topographic and sediment texture adjustment, is most likely to occur when overall sediment mobility and grain size sorting are relatively high.},

abstract = {Flume experiments are presented in which four distinct gravel and sand sediments were armored under three different flow rates. Following bed armoring, 134 clusters were identified on nine different armored beds. Clusters were separated into two categories, line and pebble, based on their morphology. Each cluster generated a recirculation cell characterized by increased turbulence that extended from just past the cluster crest in the downstream direction. The areas and orientations of the recirculation cells, together with analyses of the turbulent flow parameters and quadrant analyses, measured the influence of representative clusters on the surrounding flow field. The two basic types of cluster morphology produced very different effects on turbulent channel flows. Pebble clusters formed large recirculation cells and increased values of kinetic energy and momentum flux were measured vertically as well as longitudinally away from the cluster. Recirculation cells generated by line clusters were generally smaller and remained closer to the bed surface, restricting the impact of line clusters to flow at or below the cluster crest. The morphology of the line cluster induced turbulent processes similar to skimming flows. The difference in cluster influence over the immediate flow hydraulics was connected to the cluster morphology and orientation of the recirculation cell generated at the cluster. Line and pebble clusters formed as part of the armored bed surface structure at all the flow rates and grain size distributions tested without showing any preference. These results have potential implications for the general understanding and modeling of flows over armored gravel beds as the pebble and line clusters require morphology specific modeling. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Association for Hydro-environment Engineering and Research, Asia Pacific Division.},

However, empirical evidence for the occurrence of emergent spatial patterning is scarce, which questions the relevance of the proposed mechanisms to ecological theory. We report on regular spatial patterns in young mussel beds on soft sediments in the Wadden Sea. We propose that scale-dependent feedback, resulting from short-range facilitation by mutual protection from waves and currents and long-range competition for algae, induces spatial self-organization, thereby providing a possible explanation for the observed patterning. The emergent self-organization affects the functioning of mussel bed ecosystems by enhancing productivity and resilience against disturbance. Moreover, self-organization allows mussels to persist at algal concentrations that would not permit survival of mussels in a homogeneous bed. Our results emphasize the importance of self-organization in affecting the emergent properties of natural systems at larger spatial scales.},

This simple methodology allowed the evolution of the painted clusters to be followed and also allowed a survey of the dislodgment of the clusters particles and the addition of new ones. The experiment shows that the mobility of the wake grains is higher than that of the stoss particles. A pebble cluster generally loses the wake grain first, followed by the stoss pebbles. The obstacel clast is commonly the last to be entrained and acts as a single particle after the wake and stoss particles have been dislodged. Different explanations of this unexpected behaviour are postulated and the interaction of pebble with bed armouring and bedload size distribution is discussed. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

abstract = {A broad sheet of water flowing over non-cohesive sediment typically breaks up into a network of interconnected channels called a braided stream (Fig. 1). The dynamics of such networks are complex; channels migrate laterally, split, rejoin and develop bars, with the flow shifting unpredictably from one part of the network to another. Many processes are known to operate in a braided river1-3, but it is unclear which of these are essential to explain the observed dynamics. We describe here a simple, deterministic numerical model of water flow over a cohesionless bed that captures the main spatial and temporal features of real braided rivers. The patterns arise from local scour and deposition caused by a nonlinear dependence of bedload sediment flux on water discharge. Although the morphology of the resulting network depends in detail on the sediment-transport rule used in the model, our results suggest that the only factors essential for braiding are bedload sediment transport and laterally unconstrained free-surface flow. {\textcopyright} 2002 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a generalized Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) (gLoG) filter for detecting general elliptical blob structures in images. The gLoG filter can not only accurately locate the blob centers but also estimate the scales, shapes, and orientations of the detected blobs. These functions can be realized by generalizing the common 3-D LoG scale-space blob detector to a 5-D gLoG scale-space one, where the five parameters are image- domain coordinates (x, y), scales ($\sigma$x, $\sigma$y), and orientation ($\Theta$), respectively. Instead of searching the local extrema of the image's 5-D gLoG scale space for locating blobs, a more feasible solution is given by locating the local maxima of an intermediate map, which is obtained by aggregating the log-scale-normalized convolution responses of each individual gLoG filter. The proposed gLoG-based blob detector is applied to both biomedical images and natural ones such as general road-scene images. For the biomedical applications on pathological and fluorescent microscopic images, the gLoG blob detector can accurately detect the centers and estimate the sizes and orientations of cell nuclei. These centers are utilized as markers for a watershed-based touchingcell splitting method to split touching nuclei and counting cells in segmentation-free images. For the application on road images, the proposed detector can produce promising estimation of texture orientations, achieving an accurate texture-based road vanishing point detection method. The implementation of our method is quite straightforward due to a very small number of tunable parameters. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

We first show that the bed elevation distribution is close to Gaussian and then investigate gravel-bed roughness using the second-order structure function. The latter reveals two distinct regions: a scaling region at small spatial lags and a saturation region at large scales. The scaling exponent H (a form of Hurst exponent) appears to be isotropic and universal for both manually created 'unworked' gravel beds (H = 0.5) and natural water-worked gravel beds (H = 0.79). However, the gravel-bed roughness, in general, is not isotropic and should be characterized by three independent characteristic scales.

abstract = {The geomorphic effect of introducing a gravel augmentation totaling 520 m3 into a gravel-bed stream during a dam-controlled flood in May of 2015 was monitored with bedload transport measurements, an array of seismometers, and repeated topographic surveys. Half of the augmented gravel was injected into the flow with front-end loaders on the rising limb of the flood and the other half was injected on the first day of the peak. Virtually all of the gravel transported past the injection point was deposited within about 7 to 10 channel widths of the injection point. Most of the injected gravel deposited along the left bank of the river whereas the right half of the channel bed was dominated by scour. The downstream third of the depositional area consisted of a small dune field that developed prior to the second gravel injection and subsequently migrated about one channel width downstream. A second depositional front was observed upstream from the gravel injection point, where a delta-like wedge of bed material developed in the first hours of the flow release and changed little over the remainder of the release. These two depositional areas represent small-scale bed-material storage reservoirs with the potential to accumulate and periodically release packets of bed material. Interactions with such storage reservoirs are hypothesized to cause large bed-material pulses to disperse by fragmenting into multiple smaller pulses. As a refinement to the conceptual model that views sediment pulse evolution in terms of dispersion and translation, the concept of pulse fragmentation has practical implications for gravel management. It implies that gravel augmentations can produce morphologic changes at locations that are separated from the augmentation point by arbitrarily long reaches, and it highlights the dependence of pulse propagation rates on the nature and distribution of the bed-material storage reservoirs in the channel system.

abstract = {Recent sediment transport research has demonstrated that microform bed clusters (MBC) are particularly resistant to entrainment during floods and preliminary biological surveys have shown that such structures could be providing important refugia for benthos in streams. We therefore surveyed MBC in a selection of headwater streams, South Island, New Zealand to determine how common such structures are and then related their occurrence to flow variability, relative armouring, reach gradient, and sediment geology/geometry to obtain a greater understanding of hydrological and hydraulic stream-scale factors affecting their density and composition. MBC were present in all streams and ranged in density from 0.067 to 0.279 m−2. They occupied up to 4.4{\%} of the surface area of the survey reaches, generally had 2–3 particles (a maximum of 7), and the average size for the largest particles ranged from 18.5 to 42.8 cm. MBC density and percentage site cover was significantly related to the relative armouring, but not to flow variability. The number of sediment particles per cluster was significantly correlated with reach gradient, although sediment geology, and associated geometry of particles, also appeared to be important. Thus, density and structure of MBC appeared to be primarily controlled by the interaction of relative armouring and reach gradient with highest densities and the largest number of cluster particles occurring in steep streams with high bed armouring. These structures were sufficiently common to be playing a significant role as flood refugia for benthos in some high gradient, headwater streams. {\textcopyright} 1997, Copyright Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

Some (predominantly at low- and mid-latitude) are radar-bright and braided, resembling desert washes where fines have been removed by energetic surface liquid flow, presumably from methane rainstorms. Others (predominantly at high latitudes) are radar-dark and meandering and drain into or connect polar lakes, suggesting slower-moving flow depositing fine-grained sediments. A third type, seen predominantly at mid- and high latitudes, have radar brightness patterns indicating topographic incision, with valley widths of up to 3 km across and depth of several hundred meters. These observations show that fluvial activity occurs at least occasionally at all latitudes, not only at the Huygens landing site, and can produce channels much larger in scale than those observed there. The areas in which channels are prominent so far amount to about 1{\%} of Titan's surface, of which only a fraction is actually occupied by channels. The corresponding global sediment volume inferred is not enough to account for the extensive sand seas. Channels observed so far have a consistent large-scale flow pattern, tending to flow polewards and eastwards. {\textcopyright} 2008.},

abstract = {Well-defined vegetation patterns are a widespread feature of dryland landscapes, where spotted, banded, or other organized systems of vegetation patches are bordered by bare soil. A number of different mechanisms have been invoked to explain the emergence of these patterns and to associate their geometrical features to the driving (biotic and abiotic) processes. A commonly accepted theory of pattern formation is based on the interplay between mechanisms of short-range facilitation and long-range competition with surrounding vegetation. Recently associated with the emergence of vegetation patterns, these short- and long-range interactions have been seldom interpreted as a means for plants to enhance their chances of survival in arid environments. Here we develop a simplistic facilitation-competition model to show how these spatial interactions increase the productivity of dryland ecosystems. Stable (sparsely) vegetated states are shown to occur even in systems in which unvegetated conditions are the only stable state of the local dynamics (i.e., in the absence of spatial interaction). Pattern emergence is also interpreted as an easily detectable sign of the occurrence of highly effective resource allocation and use due to spatial interactions. Moreover, the resilience of vegetated states is qualitatively related to pattern geometry. Copyright 2006 by the American Geophysical Union.},

Advancement of microfocus X-ray computed tomography ($\mu$XCT) technology has enabled 3D visualization of particles at the grain-scale with reasonably high resolution to reveal the particle morphology. This paper utilizes the real part of spherical harmonic (SH) functions to describe the morphology of general-shape sand particles acquired from $\mu$XCT images. The influence of the maximum degree of SH functions and mesh fineness on the determination of size and shape descriptors of the particles are systematically investigated. Correlations between different shape descriptors of the studied sands are examined. Utilizing principal component analysis (PCA) and the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF), a probabilistic approach considering both intrinsic and phenomenological correlations between SH coefficients is proposed to three-dimensionally regenerate the sand particles. Based on comprehensive and quantitative comparisons between the morphological characteristics of scanned and generated particles, we conclude that the proposed approach performs satisfactorily.},

abstract = {Habitat structures are built in rivers to provide feeding and resting areas for fish. At the present time, only rough guidelines are available for the design of these structures. This paper presents the results of a laboratory study on the flow and erosion around simple habitat structures. Hemispheres with diameter D of 74 and 130 mm were placed on smooth, rough as well as erodible beds and Froude number of the approaching flow was in the range of 0.074 to 0.6. The relative depth d/h where d is the depth of and h is the height of the body was found to be the important parameter and was varied from about 0.6 to 4.3. Four different regimes of flow were found, which were classified based on the relative depth. Downstream of the body, there was a recirculation region (closed wake) with a length of about 2D which was followed by an open turbulent wake. The structure of flow in this open wake was analyzed in two layers using the concept of the wall wake. In the plane of symmetry, the inner layer was analyzed using the law of the wall whereas the outer layer was analyzed using the wake equation of Schlichting. The variation of the velocity in the transverse direction was also analyzed using the concept of similar profiles. Further an empirical correlation was found for the velocity scale. The amplification of the bed shear stress near the body, especially for the rough bed was significant. Some observations were also made on the nature of erosion around the hemisphere placed on erodible beds of two sand sizes of 1.11 and 2.1 mm. It was found that the pattern of erosion was different for the different flow regimes. The maximum equilibrium clear water scour depth occurred in front of hemispherical bodies and was approximately equal to 0.67 D.},

abstract = {Fluid-sheared granular transport sculpts landscapes and undermines infrastructure, yet predicting the onset of sediment transport remains notoriously unreliable. For almost a century, this onset has been treated as a discontinuous transition at which hydrodynamic forces overcome gravity-loaded grain-grain friction. Using a custom laminar-shear flume to image slow granular dynamics deep into the bed, here we find that the onset is instead a continuous transition from creeping to granular flow. This transition occurs inside the dense granular bed at a critical viscous number, similar to granular flows and colloidal suspensions and inconsistent with hydrodynamic frameworks. We propose a new phase diagram for sediment transport, where ∼ bed load(tm) is a dense granular flow bounded by creep below and suspension above. Creep is characteristic of disordered solids and reminiscent of soil diffusion on hillslopes. Results provide new predictions for the onset and dynamics of sediment transport that challenge existing models.},

An acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) was used to measure the instantaneous three-dimensional velocity components. Four methods of estimating near-bed shear stress were compared. The results suggested a significant effect of boulder spacing and boulder submergence ratio on the near-bed shear stress estimations and their spatial distributions. It was found that at unsubmerged condition, the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and modified TKE methods can be used interchangeably to estimate the near-bed shear stress. At both submerged and unsubmerged conditions, the Reynolds method performed differently from the other point-methods. Moreover, a quadrant analysis was performed to examine the turbulent events and their contribution to the near-bed Reynolds shear stress with the effect of boulder spacing. Generally, the burst events (ejections and sweeps) were reduced in the presence of boulders. This study may improve the understanding of the effect of the boulder spacing and boulder submergence ratio on the near-bed shear stress estimations of stream restoration practices.},

In an effort to frame a more inclusive paradigm for river management, we discuss sediment inputs, transport, and storage within river systems; interactions among water, sediment, and valley context; and the need to broaden the natural flow regime concept. Explicitly incorporating sediment is challenging, because sediment is supplied, transported, and stored by nonlinear and episodic processes operating at different temporal and spatial scales than water and because sediment regimes have been highly altered by humans. Nevertheless, managing for a desired balance between sediment supply and transport capacity is not only tractable, given current geomorphic process knowledge, but also essential because of the importance of sediment regimes to aquatic and riparian ecosystems, the physical template of which depends on sediment-driven river structure and function.},

abstract = {At the smallest scales of sediment transport in rivers, the coherent structures of the turbulent boundary layer constitute the fundamental mechanisms of bedload transport, locally increasing the instantaneous hydrodynamic forces acting on sediment particles, and mobilizing them downstream. Near the critical threshold for initiating sediment motion, the interactions of the particles with these unsteady coherent structures and with other sediment grains, produce localized transport events with brief episodes of collective motion occurring due to the near-bed velocity fluctuations. Simulations of these flows pose a significant challenge for numerical models aimed at capturing the physical processes and complex non-linear interactions that generate highly intermittent and self-similar bedload transport fluxes. In this investigation we carry out direct numerical simulations of the flow in a rectangular flat-bed channel, at a Reynolds number equal to Re = 3632, coupled with the discrete element method to simulate the dynamics of spherical particles near the bed. We perform two-way coupled Lagrangian simulations of 48,510 sediment particles, with 4851 fixed particles to account for bed roughness. Our simulations consider a total of eight different values of the non-dimensional Shields parameter to study the evolution of transport statistics. From the trajectory and velocity of each sediment particle, we compute the changes in the probability distribution functions of velocities, bed activity, and jump lengths as the Shields number increases. For the lower shear stresses, the intermittency of the global bedload transport flux is described by computing the singularity or multifr actal spectrum of transport, which also characterizes the widespread range of transport event magnitudes. These findings can help to identify the mechanisms of sediment transport at the particle scale. The statistical analysis can also be used as an ingredient to develop larger, upscaled models for predicting mean transport rates, considering the variability of entrainment and deposition that characterizes the transport near the threshold of motion.},

abstract = {A novel hydrodynamic model for the threshold of cohesionless sediment particle motion under a steady unidirectional streamflow is presented. The hydrodynamic forces (drag and lift) acting on a solitary sediment particle resting over a closely packed bed formed by the identical sediment particles are the primary motivating forces. The drag force comprises of the form drag and form induced drag. The lift force includes the Saffman lift, Magnus lift, centrifugal lift, and turbulent lift. The points of action of the force system are appropriately obtained, for the first time, from the basics of micro-mechanics. The sediment threshold is envisioned as the rolling mode, which is the plausible mode to initiate a particle motion on the bed. The moment balance of the force system on the solitary particle about the pivoting point of rolling yields the governing equation. The conditions of sediment threshold under the hydraulically smooth, transitional, and rough flow regimes are examined. The effects of velocity fluctuations are addressed by applying the statistical theory of turbulence. This study shows that for a hindrance coefficient of 0.3, the threshold curve (threshold Shields parameter versus shear Reynolds number) has an excellent agreement with the experimental data of uniform sediments. However, most of the experimental data are bounded by the upper and lower limiting threshold curves, corresponding to the hindrance coefficients of 0.2 and 0.4, respectively. The threshold curve of this study is compared with those of previous researchers. The present model also agrees satisfactorily with the experimental data of nonuniform sediments.},

abstract = {According to the Bagnold hypothesis for equilibrium bed load transport, a necessary constraint for the maintenance of equilibrium bed load transport is that the fluid shear stress at the bed must be reduced to the critical, or threshold, value associated with incipient motion of grains. It was shown in a companion paper [Seminara et al., 2002], however, that the Bagnold hypothesis breaks down when applied to equilibrium bed load transport on beds with transverse slopes above a relatively modest value that is well below the angle of repose. An investigation of this failure resulted in a demonstration of its lack of validity even for nearly horizontal beds. The constraint is here replaced with an entrainment formulation, according to which a dynamic equilibrium is maintained by a balance between entrainment of bed grains into the bed load layer and deposition of bed load grains onto the bed. The entrainment function is formulated so that the entrainment rate is an increasing function of the excess of the fluid shear stress at the bed over the threshold value. The formulation is implemented with the aid of a unique set of laboratory data that characterizes equilibrium bed load transport at relatively low shear stresses for streamwise angles of bed inclination varying from nearly 0° to 22°. The formulation is shown to provide a description of bed load transport on nearly horizontal beds that fits the data as well as that resulting from the Bagnold constraint. The entrainment formulation has the added advantage of not requiring the unrealistically high dynamic coefficient of Coulomb friction resulting from the Bagnold constraint. Finally, the entrainment formulation provides reasonable and consistent results on finite streamwise and transverse bed slopes, even those at which the Bagnold formulation breaks down completely.},

abstract = {One way to study the mechanism of gravel bed load transport is to seed the bed with marked gravel tracer particles within a chosen patch and to follow the pattern of migration and dispersal of particles from this patch. In this study, we invoke the probabilistic Exner equation for sediment conservation of bed gravel, formulated in terms of the difference between the rate of entrainment of gravel into motion and the rate of deposition from motion. Assuming an active layer formulation, stochasticity in particle motion is introduced by considering the step length (distance traveled by a particle once entrained until it is deposited) as a random variable. For step lengths with a relatively thin (e.g., exponential) tail, the above formulation leads to the standard advection-diffusion equation for tracer dispersal. However, the complexity of rivers, characterized by a broad distribution of particle sizes and extreme flood events, can give rise to a heavy-tailed distribution of step lengths. This consideration leads to an anomalous advection-diffusion equation involving fractional derivatives. By identifying the probabilistic Exner equation as a forward Kolmogorov equation for the location of a randomly selected tracer particle, a stochastic model describing the temporal evolution of the relative concentrations is developed. The normal and anomalous advection-diffusion equations are revealed as its long-time asymptotic solution. Sample numerical results illustrate the large differences that can arise in predicted tracer concentrations under the normal and anomalous diffusion models. They highlight the need for intensive data collection efforts to aid the selection of the appropriate model in real rivers.},

(1989). The list includes 214 native naturally-spawning stocks: 101 at high risk of extinction, 58 at moderate risk of extinction, 54 of special concern, and one classified as threatened under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and as endangered by the state of California. The decline in native salmon, steelhead, and sea-run cutthroat populations has resulted from habitat loss and damage, and inadequate passage and flows caused by hydropower, agriculture, logging, and other developments; overfishing, primarily of weaker stocks in mixed-stock fisheries; and negative interactions with other fishes, including nonnative hatchery salmon and steelhead. While some attempts at remedying these threats have been made, they have not been enough to prevent the broad decl...},

abstract = {At the reach scale, a channel adjusts to sediment supply and flow through mutual interactions among channel form, bed particle size, and flow dynamics that govern river bed mobility. Sediment can impair the beneficial uses of a river, but the timescales for studying recovery following high sediment loading in the field setting make flume experiments appealing. We use a flume experiment, coupled with field measurements in a gravel-bed river, to explore sediment transport, storage, and mobility relations under various sediment supply conditions. Our flume experiment modeled adjustments of channel morphology, slope, and armoring in a gravel-bed channel. Under moderate sediment increases, channel bed elevation increased and sediment output increased, but channel planform remained similar to pre-feed conditions. During the following degradational cycle, most of the excess sediment was evacuated from the flume and the bed became armored. Under high sediment feed, channel bed elevation increased, the bed became smoother, mid-channel bars and bedload sheets formed, and water surface slope increased. Concurrently, output increased and became more poorly sorted. During the last degradational cycle, the channel became armored and channel incision ceased before all excess sediment was removed. Selective transport of finer material was evident throughout the aggradational cycles and became more pronounced during degradational cycles as the bed became armored. Our flume results of changes in bed elevation, sediment storage, channel morphology, and bed texture parallel those from field surveys of Redwood Creek, northern California, which has exhibited channel bed degradation for 30 years following a large aggradation event in the 1970s. The flume experiment suggested that channel recovery in terms of reestablishing a specific morphology may not occur, but the channel may return to a state of balancing sediment supply and transport capacity.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to identify a numerical method to simulate motion of a packed or fluidized bed of fuel particles in combustion chambers, such as a grate furnace and a rotary kiln. Therefore, the various numerical methods applied in the areas of granular matter and molecular dynamics were reviewed extensively. As a result, a time driven approach was found to be suited for the numerical simulation of particle motion in combustion chambers. Furthermore, this method can also be employed to moving boundaries which are required for the present application e.g. travelling grate. The method works in a Lagrangian frame of reference, which uses the position and orientation of particles as independent variables. These are obtained by time integration of the three-dimensional dynamics equations derived from the classical Newtonian approach for each particle. This includes the keeping track of all forces and momentums acting on each particle at every time step. Viscoelastic contact forces include normal and tangential components with viscoelastic models for energy dissipation and friction. The particle shapes are approximated by spheres and ellipsoids with a varying size and ratio of the semi-axis accounting for the variety of particle geometries in a combustion chamber. For these shapes the overlap of particles during contact is expressed by a polynomial of 4th order in the two-dimensional case and a polynomial of 6th order in the three-dimensional case. A new algorithm to detect two-dimensional elliptical particle contact with sufficient accuracy was developed. It is based on a sequence of coordinate transformations and has demonstrated its reliability in numerous applications. Finally, the method was applied to simulate the motion of spherical and elliptical particles in a rectangular enclosure, on a travelling grate, and in a rotary kiln.},

Morphological style is determined chiefly by the caliber and quantity of sediment delivered to the channel, although modulated by channel scale. Yet the relations between sediment transport and river morphology have received only limited, qualitative attention. In this review, the problem is studied by defining sediment transport regimes on the basis of the Shields number, a nondimensional. measure of the capacity of the channel to move sediment of a given caliber. The problem is also approached from an inverse perspective by which the quantity and character of sediment deposits are used to infer details about the variation of sediment transport and sedimentation along a channel. Coupling the two approaches establishes a basis to gain new insights into the origins of alluvial channel morphology. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2006 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Gravity-driven turbulent bedload transport has been extensively studied over the past century in regard to its importance for Earth surface processes such as natural riverbed morphological evolution. In the present contribution, the influence of the longitudinal channel inclination angle on gravity-driven turbulent bedload transport is studied in an idealised framework considering steady and uniform flow conditions. From an analytical analysis based on the two-phase continuous equations, it is shown that: (i) the classical slope correction of the critical Shields number is based on an erroneous formulation of the buoyancy force, (ii) the influence of the slope is not restricted to the critical Shields number but affects the whole transport formula and (iii) pressure-driven and gravity-driven turbulent bedload transport are not equivalent from the slope influence standpoint. Analysing further the granular flow driving mechanisms, the longitudinal slope is shown to not only influence the fluid bed shear stress and the resistance of the granular bed, but also to affect the fluid flow inside the granular bed - responsible for the transition from bedload transport to debris flow. The relative influence of these coupled mechanisms allows us to understand the evolution of the vertical structure of the granular flow and to predict the transport rate scaling law as a function of a rescaled Shields number. The theoretical analysis is validated with coupled fluid-discrete element simulations of idealised gravity-driven turbulent bedload transport, performed over a wide range of Shields number values, density ratios and channel inclination angles. In particular, all the data are shown to collapse onto a master curve when considering the sediment transport rate as a function of the proposed rescaled Shields number.},

Complex fluid/particle and particle/particle interactions lead to a broad distribution of transport behaviors under the same set of flow conditions. In this paper, we investigate the plausibility of heavy-tailed movements for particles in bed load transport using carefully controlled flume experiments and theoretical analysis. In our experimental setting, we find travel distances for particles of a given size follow an exponential distribution whose mean varies with grain size. Building on previous work of Stark et al. (2009), we then develop a probability model to show how heavy-tailed distributions of travel distance can emerge from a mixture of particle sizes. Heavy-tailed travel distance can lead to anomalous diffusion in bed load transport, modeled by fractional derivatives in the transport equation.},

Most research for establishing correspondence uses only two frames of a sequence to solve this problem. By using a sequence of frames, it is possible to exploit the fact that due to inertia the motion of an object cannot change instantaneously. By using smoothness of motion, it is possible to solve the correspondence problem for arbitrary motion of several nonrigid objects in a scene. We formulate the correspondence problem as an optimization problem and propose an iterative algorithm to find trajectories of points in a monocular image sequence. A modified form of this algorithm is useful in case of occlusion also. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach considering synthetic, laboratory, and real scenes.

@article{Bagnold1956,
abstract = {Part I. The results of previous experiments (Bagnold 1954) on the stresses set up in a uniform gravity-free dispersion of solid grains when uniformly sheared in a fluid are applied to the non-uniform case of grain flow over a gravity bed, assuming the results are quantitatively applicable to any sufficiently thin shear layer. It is found that if the bed is composed entirely of potentially mobile grains a stress-equilibrium relation at the bed surface can be defined whereby the magnitude of a certain 'bed load' of grains in transit over unit bed area is given in terms of the applied tangential stress. The bed load is independent both of the existence of any additional suspended load and of the degree of dispersion of the grains. The state of internal fluid motion enters as a single experimental constant. From a consideration of the stability of this equilibrium relation it is possible to predict the conditions under which an initially plane bed surface should become rippled; and general quantitative agreement is found with experimental data both for wind-blown and water-driven grains. Primary and secondary bed rippling are distinguished. The magnitude of the 'form-drag' due to primary bed ripples can be calculated. That due to secondary ripples is definable as an experimental constant. The gravity-free experiments disclosed that the shear resistance of a grain dispersion may vary as the square or the first power of the rate of shear, analogously to that of a true fluid, according to the value of a number G analogous to a Reynolds number. The square law is followed when the effects of grain inertia dominate over those of fluid viscosity. Assuming that the phenomenon of 'saltation' as observed over a gravity bed is an inertia effect, the conditions for saltation are predictable. The results again agree quantitatively with observation. Part II. The resistance offered by the grains to their displacement along the flow is shown to be proportional to their normal immersed weight component. And their measurable mass transport rate is hereby proportional to the rate of useful work done in transporting them. On this basis separate expressions are found for the transport rates of the bed load and suspended load, in terms of the applied tangential stress and of a tangential and a normal relative velocity respectively. When conditions are restricted to those of the 'stream case' these velocities become constant for any given system, being functions of an appropriate constant mean drag coefficient. The bed-load transport-rate expression found gives magnitudes, and variations of magnitude with grain size, in agreement with the experimental data for wind-blown sand. Agreement is also found for water-driven grains in open channels from the threshold of movement up to a certain value of the applied stress. The experimental rates are then found to increase suddenly. This increase is attributed to the development of an additional suspended load. The abrupt development of a suspended load may be explained as due to a change in the nature of the fluid turbulence when the stationary boundary becomes occluded from the fluid flow by a concentrated layer of moving bed-load grains. The assumption that under these new moving-boundary conditions the available fluid energy derived from shearing over the bed is equally apportioned between bed-load and suspended-load transport work leads to values for the suspended-load transport rate which agree closely with the experimental data. A critical relation emerges between the gravity slope of the bed, the fall velocity and the mean transport velocity of the suspended grains at which their transport may become very large. Conditions are examined under which the steady transport may be possible of grains of heterogeneous size or density. Part III. When the fluid flow is non-inertial (laminar) and the grain flow is also non-inertial the semi-empirical relations found previously for the internal stresses are such that both viscosity and shear rate can be eliminated, and a differential equation obtained whose solution gives the grain concentration in terms only of distance from the bed and of the applied tangential stress. It appears that with constant applied stress (unlimited flow depth) the degree of grain dispersion greatly exceeds that to be expected in turbulent fluid flow. But when the applied stress diminishes linearly with distance from the bed boundary a possible solution gives constant grain concentration throughout the flow. This appears to explain certain experimental results, including the behaviour of 'slurries'. The effect is examined of a fixed or partially fixed bed on the grain flow in a turbulent fluid. The effect may be pronounced in the case of suspended grains. Under certain clearly definable conditions a loose grain bed must cease to remain stationary. And if the fluid flow above is turbulent the whole grain bed should flow at constant maximum concentration, underneath the flow proper and separated from it by a moving-bed surface interface at which the concentration is discontinuous. This explains phenomena sometimes found under river torrents. The factors giving rise to and limiting the development of bed features (dunes) on a bigger scale than ripples are examined. Dune formation appears as an inherent tendency of the grain flow alone, which may or may not be inhibited by the conditions of the fluid flow.},

The cornerstone of the proposed model is based on the concept that the particle motion is governed by the intermittent nature of near-bed turbulence. Based on this mechanism, in this article we provide a quantitative model for predicting the commencement of sediment entrainment for the first time under three representative bed packing densities corresponding to the isolated, wake interference, and skimming flow regimes.

However, there are scarce simulations based on DEM in literatures considering the irregularity of particle shape. A new method is proposed to simulate individual real particle with irregular shape using clump constituted by overlapping spheres. First, the geometric model of real particle with surface nodes and inner nodes is established through digitally processing the computerized tomography (CT) scanning data. Second, a clump consisting of spheres is generated to simulate the real particle using a minimum distance criterion. The criterion is implemented by tree optimization algorithm. Influential factors are also introduced to balance the model accuracy and computing cost. Effects of the influential factors, including the density of geometric grid and the minimum distance, on simulations are discussed. Results show that this new method is simpler and more efficient than the previous methods in terms of the model accuracy and computing cost.},

This research area has received much attention during the last two decades, and will continue to grow as LES is applied to an even wider range of flows. It is deceptively difficult to generate inlet turbulence that is appropriate for a specific problem being simulated and various methods have been designed to improve this "appropriateness". We present a review of such turbulent inflow boundary conditions, broadly classified into library-based methods, recycling-rescaling-based methods, and synthetic turbulence generators. The last category is given more attention to cover a variety of creative approaches that are found in the literature, as well as due to its practicality. Selection of a particular method for a particular application is a compromise between the required fidelity and the allowable complexity and computational expense. An example case study is presented to illustrate the issues involved in the selection and adaptation process.},

abstract = {Diffusion models have been widely applied to describe fluvial long profiles. However, aggrading rivers simulated in laboratory experiments typically display much less profile curvature than a diffusion model would predict, whether aggradation is driven by subsidence or by base-level rise. Here we explore the possibility that this is due to nonclassical or non-Fickian, anomalous sediment transport in braided networks, which are known to have fractal planform geometry. We solve a fractional diffusion equation for a steady state aggrading fluvial profile for fractional exponents in the spatial derivative a in the range 1.1 {\textless} a + 1 {\textless} 2. The domain is bounded at both ends, and a constant sediment sink forces extraction of all of the imposed, constant sediment supply. We assume the fractional behavior is expressed solely by a nonlocal sediment flux term. Using the right-hand Caputo fractional derivative, we are able to construct a fractional diffusion equation that admits an analytical fluvial profile closely matching the laboratory-scale physical observations. We show that this solution is also in good agreement with a Monte Carlo simulation obtained using step lengths drawn from a L{\'{e}}vy probability density. However, despite the clear nonlocal behavior, we are unable to establish a direct physical link between the power law statistics of the fluvial transport system and the mathematical ingredients in a fractional diffusion model. In general, we expect the fractional behavior to be most pronounced when the length scale of significant downstream sediment extraction is comparable to the scale range of the fractal channel pattern behavior. This is typically the case for laboratory experiments but not at field scales, which could explain why anomalously flat fluvial long profiles have not been reported from the field. Applying fractional calculus to depositional river profiles, at any scale, exposes problems in applying fractional calculus posed by the bounded domain and the presence of a distributed sink associated with sediment extraction. With present understanding, the benefit of fractional calculus, which is its ability to capture effects of power law statistics in the underlying dynamics, comes at a significant cost in terms of flexibility to handle other physical effects such as complex domains, boundary conditions, and source terms.},

@article{Corwin2005,
abstract = {Glasses are rigid, but flow when the temperature is increased. Similarly, granular materials are rigid, but become unjammed and flow if sufficient shear stress is applied. The rigid and flowing phases are strikingly different, yet measurements reveal that the structures of glass and liquid are virtually indistinguishable. It is therefore natural to ask whether there is a structural signature of the jammed granular state that distinguishes it from its flowing counterpart. Here we find evidence for such a signature, by measuring the contact-force distribution between particles during shearing. Because the forces are sensitive to minute variations in particle position, the distribution of forces can serve as a microscope with which to observe correlations in the positions of nearest neighbours. We find a qualitative change in the force distribution at the onset of jamming. If, as has been proposed, the jamming and glass transitions are related, our observation of a structural signature associated with jamming hints at the existence of a similar structural difference at the glass transition-presumably too subtle for conventional scattering techniques to uncover. Our measurements also provide a determination of a granular temperature that is the counterpart in granular systems to the glass-transition temperature in liquids.},

The numerical approach used there is based on two components: the Lagrangian description of the suspended particles and a simulation of the interactions of suspended and bed particles. The novelty of the paper is a bed model. It is supposed that theoretical bed layer consists of identical spherical particles distributed in space in a special way. The offered bed model is used for the simulation of saltation motion in a turbulent stream. The influence of bed structure (diameter of bed particles and bed porosity) on saltation parameters (average length and height of one jump) is studied here. A comparison of saltation parameters with corresponding experimental parameters from literature was made.},

Our approach is limited to particles of convex shape but permits to consider any combination of shape and size, which makes it very versatile. The contact detection strategy relies on the use of the Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi algorithm to compute the distance between two convex bodies. The validation of the method is based on two different test cases in three dimensions: (i) the formation of a packed pile in a cylindrical container and (ii) flow dynamics in a horizontal rotating drum. In both cases, four shapes are investigated: a sphere, a cylinder, a cube and a tetrahedron. We evidence that our numerical code, Grains3D, supplies reliable and reasonably accurate computed solutions, both for spherical and non-spherical particles. In particular, in the latter case, we show how angularity promotes the appearance of the avalanching regime at relatively high Froude number compared to the spherical counterpart. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {The transport of dense particles by a turbulent flow depends on two dimensionless numbers. Depending on the ratio of the shear velocity of the flow to the settling velocity of the particles (or the Rouse number), sediment transport takes place in a thin layer localized at the surface of the sediment bed (bedload) or over the whole water depth (suspended load). Moreover, depending on the sedimentation Reynolds number, the bedload layer is embedded in the viscous sublayer or is larger. We propose here a two-phase flow model able to describe both viscous and turbulent shear flows. Particle migration is described as resulting from normal stresses, but is limited by turbulent mixing and shear-induced diffusion of particles. Using this framework, we theoretically investigate the transition between bedload and suspended load.},

@article{Prancevic2015,
abstract = {Sediment transport rates in steep mountain channels are typically an order of magnitude lower than predicted by models developed for lowland rivers. One hypothesis for this observation is that particles are more stable in mountain channels due to particle-particle interlocking or bridging across the channel width. This hypothesis has yet to be tested, however, because we lack direct measurements of particle friction angles in steep mountain channels. Here we address this data gap by directly measuring the minimum force required to dislodge sediment (pebbles to boulders) and the sediment weight in mountain channels using a handheld force gauge. At eight sites in California, with reach-averaged bed angles ranging from 0.5 to 23 and channel widths ranging from 2 m to 16m, we show that friction angles in natural streams average 68 and are 16 larger than those typically measured in laboratory experiments, which is likely due to particle interlocking and burial. Results also show that larger grains are disproportionately more stable than predicted by existing models and that grains organized into steps are twice as stable as grains outside of steps. However, the mean particle friction angle does not vary systematically with bed slope. These results do not support systematic increases in friction angle in steeper and narrower channels to explain the observed low sediment transport rates in mountain channels. Instead, the spatial pattern and grain-size dependence of particle friction angles may indirectly lower transport rates in steep, narrow channels by stabilizing large clasts and channel-spanning steps, which act as momentum sinks due to form drag.},

abstract = {A new framework is presented that describes the hydrodynamic entrainment of sediments. The framework is derived from the general equations of particle stability and fluid motion and covers a wide range of scales, from that of the individual particle to en masse entrainment at the scale of the stream reach. Particle entrainment is explicitly shown to be driven by the combination of instantaneous fluid stress and pressure gradients, particle surface contact forces, particle submerged weight, and the weight and motion of particle-associated fluid. Of these factors, bed shear stresses, across-particle differences in pressures and fluxes of momentum, and sediment bed characteristics are found to be key factors in particle entrainment. The conventional Shields entrainment parameter is shown to be applicable to averaged en masse entrainment by steady uniform 2-D flows. This nondimensionalized bed shear stress at threshold is further demonstrated to be a function of interparticle forces and bed normal hydrodynamic forces, and thereby sediment size and other fluid, sediment and bed characteristics. Observed Shields parameter dependencies are discussed. The presented framework, which includes all relevant particle and fluid characteristics and flow dynamics, may aid understanding of entrainment mechanics, the design and analysis of further studies of entrainment, the design of parameterizations that lead to the solution of entrainment problems, and numerical modeling of combined fluid and sediment dynamics.

@article{Ancey2014,
abstract = {This paper concerns a model of bed load transport, which describes the advection and dispersion of coarse particles carried by a turbulent water stream. The challenge is to develop a microstructural approach that, on the one hand, yields a parsimonious description of particle transport at the microscopic scale and, on the other hand, leads to averaged equations at the macroscopic scale that can be consistently interpreted in light of the continuum equations used in hydraulics. The cornerstone of the theory is the proper determination of the particle flux fluctuations. Apart from turbulence-induced noise, fluctuations in the particle transport rate are generated by particle exchanges with the bed consisting of particle entrainment and deposition. At the particle scale, the evolution of the number of moving particles can be described probabilistically using a coupled set of reaction-diffusion master equations. Theoretically, this is interesting but impractical, as solving the governing equations is fraught with difficulty. Using the Poisson representation, we show that these multivariate master equations can be converted into Fokker-Planck equations without any simplifying approximations. Thus, in the continuum limit, we end up with a Langevin-like stochastic partial differential equation that governs the time and space variations of the probability density function for the number of moving particles. For steady-state flow conditions and a fixed control volume, the probability distributions of the number of moving particles and the particle flux can be calculated analytically. Taking the average of the microscopic governing equations leads to an average mass conservation equation, which takes the form of the classic Exner equation under certain conditions carefully addressed in the paper. Analysis also highlights the specific part played by a process we refer to as collective entrainment, i.e. a nonlinear feedback process in particle entrainment. In the absence of collective entrainment the fluctuations in the number of moving particles are Poissonian, which implies that at the macroscopic scale they act as white noise that mediates bed evolution. In contrast, when collective entrainment occurs, large non-Poissonian fluctuations arise, with the important consequence that the evolution at the macroscopic scale may depart significantly that predicted by the averaged Exner equation. Comparison with experimental data gives satisfactory results for steady-state flows. {\textcopyright} 2014 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {Single-molecule spectroscopy can monitor transitions between two microscopic states when these transitions are associated with the emission of photons. A general formalism is developed for obtaining the statistics of such transitions from a microscopic model when the dynamics is described by master or rate equations or their continuum analog, multidimensional reaction-diffusion equations. The focus is on the distribution of the number of transitions during a fixed observation time, the distribution of times between transitions, and the corresponding correlation functions. It is shown how these quantities are related to each other and how they can be explicitly calculated in a straightforward way for both immobile and diffusing molecules. Our formalism reduces to renewal theory when the monitored transitions either go to or originate from a single state. The influence of dynamics slow compared with the time between monitored transitions is treated in a simple way, and the probability distributions are expressed in terms of Mandel-type formulas. The formalism is illustrated by a detailed analysis of the statistics of catalytic turnovers of enzymes. When the rates of conformational changes are slower than the catalytic rates which are in turn slower than the binding relaxation rate, (1) the mean number of turnovers is shown to have the classical Michaelis-Menten form, (2) the correlation function of the number of turnovers is a direct measure of the time scale of catalytic rate fluctuations, and (3) the distribution of the time between consecutive turnovers is determined by the steady-state distribution. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The formation of bed forms in gravel bed rivers acts as a control on stream ecology and the response of rivers to floods. Available models do not reproduce the range of observed bed forms and do not consider interactions between the bed and flow hydraulics. The model presented here considers a gravel bed river as a complex system in which sediment clasts are represented as discrete elements. Simple and local rules describe the sediment and flow dynamics. Using a trimodal sediment distribution, irregular forms that scale with particle diameter develop without explicit feedback mechanisms because of the tendency of large particles to roll along the bed surface and collect into chains. Feedback mechanisms such as imbrication increase the effective entrainment threshold of groups of large particles and increase the stability of these imbricate forms. A second type of bed form is associated with saltating grains and emerges where particles are transported at a preferred distance. The development and maintenance of larger-scale bed forms require feedback between the bed and flow properties. By allowing mean velocity to adjust to bed morphology and considering the effect of acceleration on turbulence generation and mean velocity profiles we demonstrate the emergence of forms similar in morphology to gravel sheets, dunes, and riffle pools. The model is best used to complement field-based studies and is suitable for testing hypotheses of streambed behavior. Copyright 2006 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {Sediment storage in alluvial valleys can strongly modulate the downstream migration of sediment and associated contaminants through landscapes. Traditional methods for routing contaminated sediment through valleys focus on in-channel sediment transport but ignore the influence of sediment exchanges with temporary sediment storage reservoirs outside the channel, such as floodplains. In theory, probabilistic analysis of particle trajectories through valleys offers a useful strategy for quantifying the influence of sediment storage on the downstream movement of contaminated sediment. This paper describes a field application and test of this theory, using 137Cs as a sediment tracer over 45 years (1952-1997), downstream of a historical effluent outfall at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), New Mexico. The theory is parameterized using a sediment budget based on field data and an estimate of the 137Cs release history at the upstream boundary. The uncalibrated model reasonably replicates the approximate magnitude and spatial distribution of channel- and floodplain-stored 137Cs measured in an independent field study. Model runs quantify the role of sediment storage in the long-term migration of a pulse of contaminated sediment, quantify the downstream impact of upstream mitigation, and mathematically decompose the future 137Cs flux near the LANL property boundary to evaluate the relative contributions of various upstream contaminant sources. The fate of many sediment-bound contaminants is determined by the relative timescales of contaminant degradation and particle residence time in different types of sedimentary environments. The theory provides a viable approach for quantifying the long-term movement of contaminated sediment through valleys. Copyright 2005 by the American Geophysical Union.},

No other information or preprocessing of data is needed. Following Cameron, the adjacency structures are used to greatly reduce the number of inner product evaluations needed to compute the polytope support functions used in the original Gilbert, Johnson and Keerthi algorithm. When the algorithm is applied to a pair of objects that move incrementally along smooth paths, it shares the advantage of the incremental distance algorithm introduced by Lin and Canny: under appropriate conditions, the computational time is very small and does not depend significantly on the total number of object vertices. Algorithmic details and performance issues are developed fully. Computational experiments provide quantitative data on the effects of object complexity and the size of incremental object motions.},

It was found that even in the case of an extremely high relative roughness, the drag force on the protrusions may be determined from the logarithmic friction laws. A very significant lift force which tends to pull the protrusions away from the wall and into the flow was measured. This lift force was divided into two parts: A constant average value and a random fluctuation superimposed over the average. A careful statistical analysis showed that the frequency of different pressures or lift forces at the wall follows very accurately the normal error law. This fact seems to indicate that in the description of turbulence near a rough wall, the pressures must be regarded as the primary influence, not the velocities. {\textcopyright} 1949 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Information theory provides a constructive criterion for setting up probability distributions on the basis of partial knowledge, and leads to a type of statistical inference which is called the maximum-entropy estimate. It is the least biased estimate possible on the given information; i.e., it is maximally noncommittal with regard to missing information. If one considers statistical mechanics as a form of statistical inference rather than as a physical theory, it is found that the usual computational rules, starting with the determination of the partition function, are an immediate consequence of the maximum-entropy principle. In the resulting "subjective statistical mechanics," the usual rules are thus justified independently of any physical argument, and in particular independently of experimental verification; whether or not the results agree with experiment, they still represent the best estimates that could have been made on the basis of the information available. It is concluded that statistical mechanics need not be regarded as a physical theory dependent for its validity on the truth of additional assumptions not contained in the laws of mechanics (such as ergodicity, metric transitivity, equal a priori probabilities, etc.). Furthermore, it is possible to maintain a sharp distinction between its physical and statistical aspects. The former consists only of the correct enumeration of the states of a system and their properties; the latter is a straightforward example of statistical inference. {\textcopyright} 1957 The American Physical Society.},

@article{Bathurst2007a,
abstract = {Existing bed-load transport formulas may overestimate the transport rate in mountain rivers by two orders of magnitude or more. Recently published field data sets provide an opportunity to take a fresh look at the bed-load transport relationship and it is hypothesized that the overestimate is due to a failure to account for the effect of a coarse surface layer of bed material inhibiting the release of fine subsurface material. Bed-load transport is determined as gs = a$\rho$(q-qc) where q = water discharge per unit width; qc = critical value for initiation of bed material movement; $\rho$ = water density; and a = coefficient. The gs/q relationship is typically piecewise linear, characterized by two transport phases with, respectively, low and high rates of change. Twenty-one flume and 25 field data sets were used to quantify the relationship for Phase 2. The flume data confirm the dependence of a on S1.5, where S = channel slope, in agreement with earlier studies. The field data additionally show that a varies inversely with the degree of bed armoring, given by the ratio of surface to subsurface bed material size. The finding is consistent with the hypothesis and suggests the need to account for the bed material supply limitation in the bed-load transport formula. However, the available data are not entirely sufficient to rule out an alternative dependency, or codependency, on flow resistance. The critical conditions for initiation of Phase 2 transport are also quantified as a function of bed material size and channel slope. The resulting set of equations allows a more accurate estimation of Phase 2 bed-load transport rates. However, the equations are empirical and should be restricted for use within the range of conditions used in their development, to determine mean rather than instantaneous transport rates and to determine bulk transport rates, not transport by size fraction. {\textcopyright} 2007 ASCE.},

abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently - those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers - the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90{\%} and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 1995 Academic Press, Inc.},

abstract = {The focus of this paper is on the analysis of the influence of near-bed turbulence structures with the inclusion of existing coherent structures on the entrainment of saltating particles in a water stream from the Lagrangian perspective. The interactions between turbulence structures and initiation of particles movement is the key for better understanding of the physics of sediment transport and particles behaviour. These aims are addressed by use of a 3D relevant model of spherical saltating particles, in which a special procedure has been designed to produce coherent structures. In this method, the spectra of turbulent kinetic energy, consisting of four ranges, are used to generate the time series of turbulent velocities in the streamwise, vertical and transversal directions. Numerical results suggest that the initiation of sediment movement is strongly correlated to positive streamwise velocity fluctuations and as such, supports earlier laboratory experimental and field observations, showing that the sweeps and outward interactions play a crucial role in the initiation of saltating particles' movement.},

The obtained equation is an extension to previously discussed fractional diffusion equations. Our description leads to a mean squared displacement which describes enhanced, subballistic transport for long times. The short time behavior, however, is of a ballistic nature. This separation into two domains results from the introduction of a time scale through the asymptotically fractal waiting-time distribution. This is also mirrored by the observation that, for small times, our generalized diffusion equation reduces to the standard Cattaneo equation. The asymptotic probability density is of compressed Gaussian type, and thus differs from the L{\'{e}}vy tail generally found for these kinds of processes. {\textcopyright} 1998 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Burial of transported material in gravel bed rivers was examined using several hundred magnetically tagged particles. Burial depth of individual particles varies with no simple relation to particle size. Distributions of burial depth of particles were examined by considering observed burial depth of individual size groups of all mobile particles and of all tagged particles (including static ones). “Simple” (single‐peak) flow events yielded exponential distributions of burial depth of mobile particles. Distributions with secondary peaks were obtained from large and multipeak events. Season long results were skew peaked with a tendency toward uniformity. An m‐layer model is developed to account for the variation of frequency of burial depth of particles, based on the assumptions that the burial depth of particles in a simple event is exponentially distributed and the proportion of particles which change vertical position from a given layer is constant from event to event. The model is elaborated for varying mixing rates, varying scour depths, and variable behavior of different size classes. After many events the material is uniformly distributed throughout all layers, in conformity with field experience. Copyright 1994 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {The presence of sediment cover in bedrock rivers inhibits saltation-driven incision, and so accurate predictions of the relationship between bedrock exposure (F{\textless}inf{\textgreater}e{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) and relative sediment flux (sediment supply rate over capacity sediment transport rate, Q{\textless}inf{\textgreater}s{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}/Q{\textless}inf{\textgreater}t{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) are necessary to model incision and hence landscape evolution. Theoretical predictions of a linear or negative exponential form for this relationship are not consistent with laboratory data that instead demonstrate a range of different relationships. Here we use a cellular automaton (CA) model to establish how the relationship between F{\textless}inf{\textgreater}e{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and Q{\textless}inf{\textgreater}s{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}/Q{\textless}inf{\textgreater}t{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} evolves from the dynamics of, and interactions between, individual sediment grains moving through a bedrock channel. The key model parameter is the probability of grain entrainment, which is altered as a function of the number of neighboring grains in order to reproduce the enhanced mobility of isolated grains on bedrock surfaces. For each model run, an equilibrium sediment cover is attained for a specified sediment input, enabling the relationship between F{\textless}inf{\textgreater}e{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and Q{\textless}inf{\textgreater}s{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}/Q{\textless}inf{\textgreater}t{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} to be established. As well as both linear and exponential relationships, model runs reproduce other relationships observed in laboratory experiments. These other relationships require isolated grains to be more easily entrained than grains in sediment clusters, which is consistent with field observations of grain mobility. There is therefore a continuum of relationships between F{\textless}inf{\textgreater}e{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and Q{\textless}inf{\textgreater}s{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}/Q{\textless}inf{\textgreater}t{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}; the relationship that is most applicable to a particular reach will depend on the role of channel slope, roughness and shear stress in controlling the entrainment of grains from bedrock and alluvial surfaces.

The model incorporates a hiding function that resolves discrepancies observed among earlier hiding functions. The model uses the full size distribution of the bed surface, including sand, and incorporates a nonlinear effect of sand content on gravel transport rate not included in previous models. The model shares some common elements with two previous surface-based transport models, but differs in using the full surface size distribution and in that it is directly developed from a relatively comprehensive data set with unambiguous measurement of surface grain size over a range of flow, transport rate, and sediments.},

abstract = {Understanding bed load transport fluctuations in rivers is crucial for development of a transport theory and for choosing a sampling interval for "mean" transport rates. Fieldscale studies lack sufficient resolution to statistically characterize these fluctuations, while laboratory experiments are limited in scale and hence cannot be directly compared to field cases. Here we use a natural-scale laboratory channel to examine bed load transport fluctuations in a heterogeneous gravel substrate under normal flow conditions. The novelty of our approach is the application of a geometrical/statistical formalism (called the multifractal formalism), which allows characterization of the "roughness" of the series (depicting the average strength of local abrupt fluctuations in the signal) and the "intermittency" (depicting the temporal heterogeneity of fluctuations of different strength). We document a rougher and more intermittent behavior in bed load sediment transport series at low-discharge conditions, transitioning to a smoother and less intermittent behavior at high-discharge conditions. We derive an expression for the dependence of the probability distribution of bed load sediment transport rates on sampling interval. Our findings are consistent with field observations demonstrating that mean bed load sediment transport rate decreases with sampling time at low-transport conditions and increases with sampling time at high-transport conditions. Simultaneous ' measurement of bed elevation suggests that the statistics of sediment transport fluctuations are related to the statistics of bed topography.

abstract = {The nature of the von K{\'{a}}rm{\'{a}}n constant ($\kappa$), i.e. universal, Re-independent but wall-dependent or, in general, flow dependent, has been subjected to considerable investigation. Contradicting the classic view that $\kappa$ should be universal in open-channel flows of clear water with a fully developed boundary layer, irrespectively of the type of boundary, it has recently been proposed that the value of $\kappa$ is influenced by the mobility of the bottom boundary.Rather than advocating a particular view on the nature of $\kappa$, the objectives of this work are: (i) to provide a similarity framework for the nature of $\kappa$, highlighting, in the process, the underlying key phenomena at play, and (ii) to explore a theoretical model for $\kappa$ as a function of turbulence parameters.Dimensional analysis is performed, including a new key step, following the works of Selim Yalin, in which the shear-rate is interpreted as a two-phase variable, depending on flow as well as sediment parameters. Vaschy-Buckingham's theorem is applied and similarity arguments leading to the log-law are employed. These introduce appropriate hypothesis concerning complete and incomplete similarity, thus providing a theoretical framework for the discussion of the nature of $\kappa$. A theoretical model is then explored, materialised in a functional relation between $\kappa$ and turbulence parameters. The discussion of the nature of $\kappa$ becomes a discussion of the nature of those parameters, all susceptible to be measured.

abstract = {The paper presents the detailed formulation and validation results of simple and robust procedures for the generation of synthetic turbulence aimed at providing artificial turbulent content at the RANS-to-LES interface within a zonal Wall Modelled LES of attached and mildly separated wall-bounded flows. There are two versions of the procedure. The aerodynamic version amounts to a minor modification of a synthetic turbulence generator developed by the authors previously, but the acoustically adapted version is new and includes an internal damping layer, where the pressure field is computed by "weighting" of the instantaneous pressure fields from LES and RANS. This is motivated by the need to avoid creating spurious noise as part of the turbulence generation. In terms of pure aerodynamics, the validation includes canonical shear flows (developed channel flow, zero pressure gradient boundary layer, and plane mixing layer), as well as a more complex flow over the wall-mounted hump with non-fixed separation and reattachment, with emphasis on a rapid conversion from modeled to resolved Reynolds stresses. The aeroacoustic applications include the flow past a trailing edge and over a two-element airfoil configuration. In all cases the methodology ensures a very acceptable accuracy for the mean flow, turbulent statistics and, also, the near- and far-field noise. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {The purpose of the present note is to contribute to analysis of bed-load transport processes within a Lagrangian framework. Experiments were performed tracking individual particles under different bed conditions (mobile and fixed beds) at transitional hydrodynamic regimes. A new image processing procedure was designed to obtain the coordinates of each moving sediment within the intermediate range of scales (corresponding to a particle trajectory between rests periods). Thorough attention has been paid to provide consistent definitions for particle motion and trajectory, as well as to devise a rigorous method for analysis. A data set with properties of more than 4000 intermediate trajectories was obtained. Collected data were used to estimate stream-wise and transversal length and duration of intermediate trajectories and corresponding mean sediment velocities. Statistical significance of the values obtained for measured properties was ascertained by appropriate analysis. The full data set is provided with the manuscript as supplementary material. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research.},

abstract = {In contrast to using a standard control volume approach, general statements of sediment mass balance are derived herein from spatial averaging of the sub-particle-scale differential equation of solid mass conservation. The general form of the Exner equation for sediment continuity that is obtained enables analyses in terms of size fractions and also in terms of individual or successive layers, where layer interfaces (e.g., for the bed surface and for bed and suspended loads) are defined on the basis of isosurfaces of sediment concentration (volume fraction) or other sediment properties (e.g., densities or transport rates) within regions of constant concentration. The presented expressions highlight the averaged nature of variables and also the effects of the scales of consideration on definition and interpretation of the macroscopic (mixture-scale) sediment and layer properties (e.g., averaged densities, volume concentrations or fractions, velocities, transport modes and rates, interfaces, and bed layers). For appropriate simplifications, the general form of the Exner equation is shown to reduce to give more specific conventional expressions, revealing the assumptions implicit in these equations.

abstract = {River restoration is one of the most prominent areas of applied water-resources science. From an initial focus on enhancing fish habitat or river appearance, primarily through structural modification of channel form, restoration has expanded to incorporate a wide variety of management activities designed to enhance river process and form. Restoration is conducted on headwater streams, large lowland rivers, and entire river networks in urban, agricultural, and less intensively human-altered environments. We critically examine how contemporary practitioners approach river restoration and challenges for implementing restoration, which include clearly identified objectives, holistic understanding of rivers as ecosystems, and the role of restoration as a social process. We also examine challenges for scientific understanding in river restoration. These include: how physical complexity supports biogeochemical function, stream metabolism, and stream ecosystem productivity; characterizing response curves of different river components; understanding sediment dynamics; and increasing appreciation of the importance of incorporating climate change considerations and resiliency into restoration planning. Finally, we examine changes in river restoration within the past decade, such as increasing use of stream mitigation banking; development of new tools and technologies; different types of process-based restoration; growing recognition of the importance of biological-physical feedbacks in rivers; increasing expectations of water quality improvements from restoration; and more effective communication between practitioners and river scientists.},

abstract = {We introduce a new conceptual model for longitudinal and transverse diffusion of moving bed particles under weak bed load transport. For both rolling/sliding and saltating modes the model suggests that the particle motion is diffusive and comprises at least three ranges of temporal and spatial scales with different diffusion regimes: (1) the local range (ballistic diffusion), (2) the intermediate range (normal or anomalous diffusion), and (3) the global range (subdiffusion). The local range corresponds to ballistic particle trajectories between two successive collisions with the static bed particles. The intermediate range corresponds to particle trajectories between two successive periods of rest. These trajectories consist of many local trajectories and may include tens or hundreds of collisions with the bed. The global range of scales corresponds to particle trajectories consisting of many intermediate trajectories, just as intermediate trajectories consist of many local trajectories. Our data from the Balmoral Canal (the intermediate range) and Drake et al.'s [1988] data from the Duck Creek (the global range) provide strong support for this conceptual model and identify anomalous diffusion regimes for the intermediate range (superdiffusion) and the global range (subdiffusion).},

abstract = {The motion of bedload particles is diffusive and occurs within at least three scale ranges: local, intermediate and global, each of which with a distinctly different diffusion regime. However, these regimes, extensions of the scale ranges and boundaries between them remain to be better defined and quantified. These issues are explored using a Lagrangian model of saltating grains over the uniform fixed bed. The model combines deterministic particle motion dynamics with stochastic characteristics such as probability distributions of step lengths and resting times. Specifically, it is proposed that a memoryless exponential distribution is an appropriate model for the distribution of rest periods while the probability that a particle stops after a current jump follows a binomial distribution, which is a distribution with lack of memory as well. These distributions are incorporated in the deterministic Lagrangian model of saltating grains and extensive numerical simulations are conducted for the identification of the diffusive behavior of particles at different time scales. Based on the simulations and physical considerations, the local, intermediate, and global scale ranges are quantified and the transitions from one range to another are studied for a spectrum of motion parameters. The obtained results demonstrate that two different time scales should be considered for parameterization of diffusive behavior within intermediate and global scale ranges and for defining the local–intermediate and intermediate–global boundaries. The simulations highlight the importance of the distributions of the step lengths and resting times for the identification of the boundaries (or transition intervals) between the scale ranges.},

abstract = {A 524-km reach of Fraser River, British Columbia, was traversed, where the channel alternates between gravel-bedded reaches that are incised into semiconsolidated glacial deposits and bedrock-bound reaches, including Fraser Canyon. Continuous centerline acoustic Doppler current profiler survey and observations of bedrock confinement, supplemented with measurements on air photos, reveal the influence of bedrock on channel properties. The surveyed reach was subdivided into 10 morphological reaches, ranging from dominance by alluvial gravel-bed channels to dominantly rock-walled canyons. Measured data were grouped within each reach based on the presence of bedrock on both banks, one bank, or neither bank. From alluvial to mixed to canyon-dominated reaches, river widths decreased while water depths, flow velocities, water surface slopes, and bed shear stresses increased. Within reaches, subreaches with bedrock on both banks were narrower and deeper with higher bed shear stresses but, at the observed stage, had lower depth-averaged velocity and water surface slope than partly confined and alluvial (unconfined) subreaches. A conceptual model is presented representing a bedrock river as an alternating series of relatively low gradient, deep, rock-walled pools and steep semialluvial or alluvial sections. Downstream hydraulic geometry relations have scaling exponents expected for alluvial channels provided that the alluvial and rock-influenced sections are analyzed separately. In Fraser River, canyons become relatively narrower downstream, apparently in response to increasing rock uplift during the Quaternary period. The observations are compared against prior semitheoretical frameworks established to explain variations in width, slope, and channel shape along rockbound channels.},

abstract = {Bedload sediment transport is the basic physical ingredient of river evolution. Formulae exist for estimating transport rates, but the diffusive contribution to the sediment flux, and the associated spreading rate of tracer particles, are not clearly understood. The start-and-stop motions of sediment particles transported as bedload on a streambed mimic aspects of the Einstein–Smoluchowski description of the random-walk motions of Brownian particles. Using this touchstone description, recent work suggests the presence of anomalous diffusion, where the particle spreading rate differs from the linear dependence with time of Brownian behavior. We demonstrate that conventional measures of particle spreading reveal different attributes of bedload particle behavior depending on details of the calculation. When we view particle motions over start-and-stop timescales obtained from high-speed (250 Hz) imaging of coarse-sand particles, high-resolution measurements reveal ballistic-like behavior at the shortest (10−2 s) timescale, followed by apparent anomalous behavior due to correlated random walks in transition to normal diffusion ({\textgreater}10−1 s) – similar to Brownian particle behavior but involving distinctly different physics. However, when treated as a ‘virtual plume' over this timescale range, particles exhibit inhomogeneous diffusive behavior because both the mean and the variance of particle travel distances increase nonlinearly with increasing travel times, a behavior that is unrelated to anomalous diffusion or to Brownian-like behavior. Our results indicate that care is needed in suggesting anomalous behavior when appealing to conventional measures of diffusion formulated for ideal particle systems.

abstract = {Grains of a single size within a mixed-size bed are entrained over a range of flows. Within this range some grains exposed on the bed surface are active (entrained at least once over the duration of a transport event), while the remaining surface grains are immobile, a condition we define as partial transport. We demonstrate the existence and domain of partial transport using observations of grain entrainment on time series of bed photographs of flume experiments with a widely sorted sand/gravel mixture. The active proportion of the bed surface increases with bed shear stress $\tau$0. At a given $\tau$0, 90{\%} of the active grains are entrained when the cumulative mass transported exceeds approximately 4 times the active mass on the bed. Mobilization of grains in a size fraction increases from 10{\%} to 90{\%} over a range of $\tau$0 of a factor of 2. The bounds of this range increase with grain size D(i) so that at a given $\tau$0, sizes over a range of a factor of 4 are in a state of partial transport. Fractional transport rates are independent of D(i) for fully mobilized fractions and decrease rapidly with D(i) for partially mobile fractions. Partial transport is associated with substantial transport rates of finer, fully mobile sizes, limits both the rate and size distribution of grain exchange with the bed subsurface, and may be the dominant transport condition in many gravel-bed rivers.},

abstract = {Particles transported as bed load within a specified streambed area possess a distribution of velocities. This distribution figures prominently in describing the rate of sediment transport and the rate of dispersal of particles during transport. We provide a probabilistic derivation of the distributions of streamwise and cross-stream particle velocities under uniform, quasi-steady transport conditions. The formulation centers on defining the ensemble of microstates of particle momenta (the set of possible ways to partition a fixed number of particles into momentum states) subject to the constraint that the sum of the particle momenta in each microstate is fixed, a constraint that is imposed by conditions of equilibrium transport. From this, we obtain the most probable distribution of momentum states, assuming each microstate within the ensemble is equally probable. The analysis suggests that, for small particle numbers, the distribution of velocities is exponential-like but decays faster than an exponential function. For large particle numbers, the distribution is exponential. These distributions are consistent with experimental results from high-speed imaging of sand particles transported as bed load over a planar bed, which reveal that the probability distributions of streamwise and cross-stream particle velocities are exponential-like. These particle velocity distributions also emerge from numerical analyses involving large eddy simulations of turbulent fluid motions and a discrete element method describing particle motions, wherein the large eddy simulations and discrete element method models are fully coupled in momentum. {\textcopyright}2013.

abstract = {This book presents key principles of the hydraulics of river basins, with a unique focus on the interplay between stream flows and sediment transport. Addressing a number of basic topics related to the hydraulics of natural waterways, it above all emphasizes applicative aspects in order to provide the reader with a solid grasp of river engineering. The first chapter explores many of the fixed base hydraulic topics that are normally neglected in traditional texts, namely the effects on motion produced by the vegetation and macroroughnesses that characterize many mountain streams. The remaining chapters are devoted entirely to hydraulics with mobile riverbeds and put particular emphasis on inhomogeneous river channels. The book's approach goes beyond classical treatments, so as to not only introduce readers to the fundamentals of mobile riverbeds, but also enable today's river engineers to successfully design and maintain natural riverbeds.},

abstract = {The bed material grain size distribution of gravel bed streams is often spatially heterogeneous. The heterogeneity is actually a random parameter, even for a "well-mixed mixture," which potentially causes the transport rate for a given bed material to become an uncertain variable. The cause of bed material heterogeneity is the nonuniformity of the bed material, which is analyzed in this paper using examples from field observations and experimental data. The Monte Carlo simulation method is applied to study the uncertainty of the bedload transport rate using Wilcock's experimental data (P. R. Wilcock et al., 2001; P. R. Wilcock and J. C. Crowe, 2003). Each realization of the Monte Carlo simulation employed a randomly generated grain size distribution field for the entire simulation domain. With sufficient realizations the simulation results were adequate to show that the transport rates were a random variable and the mean transport rates did not fall on a single-valued curve when the local heterogeneity was taken into account. The results indicate that the bedload transport rate of nonuniform sediment has an intrinsic uncertainty that can result solely from the bed material. The results also partially account for the scatter of the fractional transport rate within Wilcock's experimental data. This study presents an important concept in understanding the uncertainty associated with estimates of sediment transport. Copyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {In this work, we developed a method to decipher the shape message imprinted in single sediment particles, a method that would reflect the detail information of surface morphology. It uses 2D mathematical descriptions to restore and characterize 3D shape and surface morphology of sediment particles in terms of the “mathematical sediment”, so as to better understand 3D geometric characteristics reflected by single sediment particles. To prevent the simplification of morphology description and overcome the deficiencies of lower-dimensional characteristics, we proposed a concept of “mathematical sediment” in this paper. The mathematical sediment uses image analysis of scanning electron microscope photographs and complex Fourier shape analysis to describe the planar projection shape of sediment particles and further restore the 3D morphology of sediment particles through a certain combination ways. The shapes of sediment particles are controlled using Fourier coefficients to generate a variety of mathematical sediments with various shapes, which allow the realization of the description and analysis of the 3D morphology of sediment particles. The fractal theory is further used to verify the rationality of mathematical sediment. Compared with the traditional method, the mathematical sediment overcomes the lack of particle system and smooth sphere systems and can reproduce 3D irregular surfaces for the morphology analysis. The rationality verification showed that the complex surface morphology of mathematical sediment is basically similar to the surface morphology of natural sediment. The mathematical sediment can reflect the true surface characteristics of sediment particles. The characteristics of shape properties and surface morphology it conveys are consistent with the natural sediment and can be used as a research basis for the further study both in fresh water and marine.},

An Immersed Boundary Method is used for the numerical representation of the particles. With 22 points per diameter even the viscous scales of the flow are resolved at this Reynolds number. The reference run contains just as many fixed as mobile particles with a relative density slightly above the nominal threshold of incipient motion. Further runs were conducted with decreased mass loading and decreased Shields number together with a simulation containing only immobile particles. The variation of the parameters defining the mobile sediment yields a strong modification of particle-fluid as well as particle-particle interactions yielding different structures in space and time. This is assessed by means of appropriate statistical quantities addressing the continuous and the disperse phase. The results are in qualitative agreement with experimental observations at higher Reynolds number.},

abstract = {Based on a method of combining stochastic processes with mechanics, a new bedload formula for the arbitrary kth size fraction of nonuniform sediment is theoretically developed by using a stochastic model of sediment exchange and the probabilistic distribution of fractional bedload transport rates. The relations, proposed recently by Sun, for the probability of fractional incipient motion and for the average velocity of particle motion are introduced to bedload formula. Plenty of experimental data for the bedload transport rate of uniform sediment are used to determine two constants. The theoretical bedload formula for any fraction of nonuniform sediment possesses several advantages, including a clear physical concept, a strict mathematical derivation, and a self-adaptability to uniform sediment. The formula is verified with natural data expressing the transport of nonuniform sediment under full motion in laboratory flume. The result shows that the experimental observations agree well with the predicted fractional bedload transport rates. Comparison of the theory with field data finds that the proposed formula still applies to partial transport of bedload in gravel-bed streams as long as the immobile percentage of bed material is taken into account.},

abstract = {Bedload, the transport of sediment remaining in contact with the stream bed, has mainly been studied from the perspective of the correlation between fluid driving forces and the responding sediment flux. Yet grain-grain interactions are important and bedload should also be considered as a granular phenomenon. We review progress made recently in the study of granular flows, especially on segregation and rheology, that better illuminates the nature of bedload. Granular flows may exhibit gas-like or fluid-like flow, or quasi-solid deformation. All three conditions might be duplicated in bedload. Understanding of intense bedload transport occurring continuously in a layer several grains deep - typical of sand beds - might greatly benefit from results in granular physics, as illustrated by grain-inspired bedload results. However, processes restricted to the surface of the bed, when particles move intermittently and the bed becomes structured, while characteristic in gravel-bed channels, are not well addressed in granular physics. Mutual study of these phenomena may benefit both physics and fluvial geomorphology. We intend, therefore, to contribute to an enhanced dialogue between granular physics and bedload science communities. {\textcopyright} 2010 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {The laboratory experiments on sediment transport conducted by G. K. Gilbert differed importantly in technique from such studies of more recent date. Gilbert's flume was level and could not be altered in slope. Sediment was introduced at the upper end at a predetermined rate and by deposition built a bed gradient sufficient to transport the introduced load. The adjustment of slope in Gilbert's flume has contributed to the idea widely held by geologists that a river achieves equilibrium by adjusting its slope to provide just the velocity required for the transportation of the supplied load. In fact, slope adjusts but little to a change in amount of introduced sediment load. The adjustment takes place principally among other hydraulic factors: width, depth, velocity, bed forms, channel pattern, and pool-riffle sequence. Gilbert sensed this complicated adjustment process, but its details are as yet only partially known in quantitative terms.},

abstract = {Bedforms in gravel-bed rivers range in size from 10-2 to 103 m and have a wide range of affects on sediment transport and channel stability. To study the affect of these bedforms on sediment transport a classification scheme is proposed that breaks the bedforms into micro, meso, macro and megaforms. Then using two creeks in British Columbia and one in California, the trend of sediment transport rates is related to the bed state, sediment and wood storage and the associated bedforms are discussed. At small spatial and temporal scales (micro/mesoform scales), variability in sediment transport rate can be ascribed to the changing state of the bed, which largely depends on the sediment supply regime. Stabilizing bedforms develop when sediment supply is low, and reduces the depth of the bed active layer and the mobility of the grains, thereby decreasing the sediment transport rate. Sediment rating relations in a low sediment supply channel are steep and are believed to be extremely sensitive to small changes in sediment supply and flow regime when compared to higher sediment supply systems. High sediment supply suppresses the development of stabilizing bedforms and increases the mobility of grains and the depth of the active layer. At the reach scale (macroform scale), high sediment mobility is shown to produce complex cycles of aggradation and degradation that can persist for decades. In-channel woody debris can strongly influence the timing and magnitude of these aggradation-degradation cycles and also has an important effect on the development of megaforms. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis is restricted to experiments where the flow-induced shear stress is just above the threshold for sediment transport. We find that, in this regime, the concentration of moving particles is low enough to neglect interactions between themselves. We can therefore represent bedload as a thin layer of independent walkers travelling over the bed surface. In addition to their downstream motion, the particles show significant fluctuations of their cross-stream velocity, likely due to the roughness of the underlying sediment bed. This causes particles to disperse laterally. Based on thousands of individual trajectories, we show that this lateral spreading is the manifestation of a random walk. The experiments are entirely consistent with Fickian diffusion. {\textcopyright} 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract = {Depth profiles of particle streamwise velocity, concentration and bedload sediment transport rate were measured in a turbulent and supercritical water flow. One-size 6mm diameter spherical glass beads were transported at equilibrium in a two-dimensional 10{\%} steep channel with a mobile bed. Flows were filmed from the side by a high-speed camera. Particle tracking algorithms made it possible to determine the position, velocity and trajectory of a very large number of particles. Approximately half of the sediment transport rate was composed by rolling grains, and the other half by saltation. This revealed a complex structure, with several concentration and flux peaks due to rolling, and one peak due to saltation. With an increase of the sediment transport rate, the depth structure remained the same at the water/granular interface, with peak value increases but with no shift in elevations. The saltation region expanded towards higher elevations with an increase of the particle velocity commensurate to the water velocity. The proportion of the sediment transport rate in saltation did not vary significantly. The particle streamwise velocity profiles exhibited three segments: an exponential decay in the bed, a linear increase where rolling and saltation co-existed, and above this, a logarithmic-like shape due to saltating particles. These results are comparable to profiles measured and modelled in dry granular free surface flows and in more intense bedload such as sheet flows. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

The observations we report on include systems consisting of units ranging from macromolecules through metallic rods and robots to groups of animals and people. Some emphasis is put on models that are simple and realistic enough to reproduce the numerous related observations and are useful for developing concepts for a better understanding of the complexity of systems consisting of many simultaneously moving entities. As such, these models allow the establishing of a few fundamental principles of flocking. In particular, it is demonstrated, that in spite of considerable differences, a number of deep analogies exist between equilibrium statistical physics systems and those made of self-propelled (in most cases living) units. In both cases only a few well defined macroscopic/collective states occur and the transitions between these states follow a similar scenario, involving discontinuity and algebraic divergences. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

A traditional Shields plot constructed from data that represent initial motion of the bed surface material reveals systematic methodological biases of incipient motion definition; $\tau$* (c)50 values determined from reference bed load transport rates and from visual observation of grain motion define subparallel Shields curves, with the latter generally underlying the former: values derived from competence functions define a separate but poorly developed field, while theoretical values predict a wide range of generally higher stresses that likely represent instantaneous, rather than time-averaged, critical shear stresses. The available data indicate that for high critical boundary Reynolds numbers and low relative roughnesses typical of gravel-bedded rivers, reference-based and visually based studies have $\tau$*(c)50 ranges of 0.052-0.086 and 0.030-0.073, respectively.

An improved expression for the pdf based on the normal error law is provided which matches the measured data up to ±3 times the standard deviation of lift force for all exposures. The skewness of the measured lift force is found to increase with increase in exposure. In addition, the kurtosis of the measured lift force is found to be higher than that for a normal distribution for all exposures, resulting in higher probability of occurrence of extreme events (beyond ±3 times standard deviation). A spectral density function of lift force as a function of streamwise and stream-normal velocity is developed and validated using the measured lift force data. The spectrum predicted by the proposed model closely follows the measured spectrum for exposures 7.5 mm and 10 mm while it over predicts at frequencies below 1 Hz for exposures 0 mm and 2.5 mm because of poor coherence between lift force and streamwise velocity. The time history plots of measured lift at lower exposures showed that the high-frequency positive and negative fluctuations of lift correspond to strongly positive streamwise velocity fluctuations, a phenomenon not captured by the predictive model. Predominance of fluctuating Bernoulli's lift over lift due to stream-normal velocity fluctuations is observed at all exposures, more so in the case of lower exposures.

abstract = {A fundamental component of stereo vision is that of epipolar geometry. It tells us that the corresponding point of a pixel in one image is restricted to a line in another image. This constraint reduces both the complexity of finding stereo correspondences and also the chance of making incorrect matches. When a refractive surface is introduced, which is in underwater imaging, this constraint no longer holds. Instead, the corresponding point of a pixel in one image is now restricted to a curve, not a line. In this paper we investigate the impact of a planar refractive interface has on underwater imaging and stereo matching. We address the issue of 3D point projection in a refractive medium, including cases where the refractive interface is not parallel with the camera's imaging plane. A novel method for calibrating the parameters of a planar refractive interface in the local image space is proposed. We show how to compute the refractive epipolar curve for a pixel, which allows us to generate a matching cost volume that compensates for the effects of refraction. Our experimental results show that our new approach can significantly improve the results of underwater stereo matching over previous approaches. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {Recent studies have observed deviation from normal (Fickian) diffusion in sediment tracer dispersion that violates the assumption of statistical convergence to a Gaussian. Nikora et al. (2002) hypothesized that particle motion at short time scales is superdiffusive because of inertia, while long-time subdiffusion results from heavy-tailed rest durations between particle motions. Here we test this hypothesis with laboratory experiments that trace the motion of individual gravels under near-threshold intermittent bed load transport (0.027 {\textless} $\tau$* {\textless} 0.087). Particle behavior consists of two independent states: a mobile phase, in which indeed we find superdiffusive behavior, and an immobile phase, in which gravels distrained from the fluid remain stationary for long durations. Correlated grain motion can account for some but not all of the superdiffusive behavior for the mobile phase; invoking heterogeneity of grain size provides a plausible explanation for the rest. Grains that become immobile appear to stay at rest until the bed scours down to an elevation that exposes them to the flow. The return time distribution for bed scour is similar to the distribution of rest durations, and both have power law tails. Results provide a physical basis for scaling regimes of anomalous dispersion and the time scales that separate these regimes. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2012 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {Widespread availability of computational power and the ability to acquire voluminous data have the potential to improve the accuracy and relevance of geomor-phic prediction, although such improvement is by no means guaranteed. A mix of fast and slow geomorphic processes, unknown initial and forcing conditions, unresolved heterogeneities, and unanticipated, typically nonlinear mechanisms make prediction difficult and problems of scale paramount. A variety of approaches to formulating geomorphic models exist, reflecting the diversity of modeler's backgrounds and goals and our incomplete understanding of many earth surface processes. Progress is facilitated by a continuing dialog among those pursuing different approaches to making and testing predictions. This paper provides a synopsis of contributions to a volume that focuses on the broader objectives, methods, and testing of geomorphic models. Why do we model and to what purpose? How do we formulate and test models? How do we evaluate whether a model has predictive capability or any utility at all? Is prediction even necessary? Despite the diverse approaches to making predictions in geomorphology, common themes in the volume highlight the need for models that unambiguously link cause and effect, the importance of rigorous and flexible model tests, and the utility of models in focusing and organizing understanding and expressing concepts in unambiguous and testable ways.},

abstract = {A high-resolution data set obtained from high-speed imaging of coarse sand particles transported as bed load allows us to confidently describe the forms and qualities of the ensemble distributions of particle velocities, accelerations, hop distances, and traveltimes. Autocorrelation functions of frame-averaged values (and the decay of these functions) support the idea that the forms of these distributions become time invariant within the 5 s imaging interval. Distributions of streamwise and cross-stream particle velocities are exponential, consistent with previous experiments and theory. Importantly, streamwise particle velocities possess a "light" tail, where the largest velocities are limited by near-bed fluid velocities. Distributions of streamwise and cross-stream particle accelerations are Laplace in form and are centered on zero, consistent with equilibrium transport conditions. The majority of particle hops, measured start to stop, involve short displacements, and streamwise hop distances possess a Weibull distribution. In contrast to previous work, the distribution of traveltimes is exponential, consistent with a fixed temporal disentrainment rate. The Weibull distribution of hop distances is consistent with a decreasing spatial disentrainment rate and is related to the exponential distribution of traveltimes. By taking into account the effects of experimental censorship associated with a finite sampling window, the relationship between streamwise hop distances and traveltimes, Lx-Tp$\alpha$, likely involves an exponent of $\alpha$2. These experimental results - an exponential distribution of traveltimes Tp and a Weibull distribution of hop distances Lx with shape parameter k {\textless} 1 - are consistent with a nonlinear relationship between these quantities with $\alpha$ {\textgreater} 1.

abstract = {A model of sand transport in water is produced by combining a turbulence-resolving large eddy simulation (LES) with a discrete element model (DEM) prescribing the motion of individual grains of medium sand. The momentum effect of each particle on the fluid is calculated at the LES cell containing the particle, and the fluid velocity and pressure, interpolated to each particle center, is used to derive fluid force on each particle in the DEM. Eleven numerical experiments are conducted of an initially flat bed of particles. The experiments span a range of motion, from essentially no motion to vigorous suspension. Hydraulic roughness is found to increase abruptly at the transition from bed load to suspended load transport. Suspended sediment extracts momentum from the flow and decreases the rate of shear. Whereas, slightly higher in the flow, vertical drag by suspended grains damps turbulence and increases the rate of shear. Vertical sediment diffusivity and effective particle settling velocity are much smaller than is commonly assumed in suspended sediment models. The bed load experiments suggest that saltation by itself is a poor model of bed load sand transport. In contrast to expectations from saltation models, the peak bed load flux occurs at essentially the same level as the bed, and grains move slowly in frequent contact with other grains. Higher- and faster-moving bed load grains that can be considered to be in saltation represent a smaller portion of the total flux. Entrainment of bed load grains occurs in response to fluid penetration of the bed by high-vorticity turbulence structures embedded within broader high speed fluid regions referred to as a sweeps or high-speed wedges. {\textcopyright}2014.

abstract = {[1] Characterizing the collective behavior of particle transport on the Earth surface is a key ingredient in describing landscape evolution. We seek equations that capture essential features of transport of an ensemble of particles on hillslopes, valleys, river channels, or river networks, such as mass conservation, superdiffusive spreading in flow fields with large velocity variation, or retardation due to particle trapping. Development of stochastic partial differential equations such as the advection-dispersion equation (ADE) begins with assumptions about the random behavior of a single particle: possible velocities it may experience in a flow field and the length of time it may be immobilized. When assumptions underlying the ADE are relaxed, a fractional ADE (fADE) can arise, with a non-integer-order derivative on time or space terms. Fractional ADEs are nonlocal; they describe transport affected by hydraulic conditions at a distance. Space fractional ADEs arise when velocity variations are heavy tailed and describe particle motion that accounts for variation in the flow field over the entire system. Time fractional ADEs arise as a result of power law particle residence time distributions and describe particle motion with memory in time. Here we present a phenomenological discussion of how particle transport behavior may be parsimoniously described by a fADE, consistent with evidence of superdiffusive and subdiffusive behavior in natural and experimental systems.

abstract = {The importance of particle-particle collisions in sediment saltation in the bed-load layer is analyzed herein by means of numerical simulation. The particle saltation theoretical/numerical model follows a Lagrangian approach, and addresses the motion of sediment particles in an open channel flow described by a logarithmic velocity profile. The model is validated with experimental data obtained from the literature. In order to evaluate the importance of the phenomenon, simulations with and without particle-particle collisions were carried out. Results for two different sediment concentrations are presented, namely 0. 13{\%} and 2.33{\%}. For each concentration of particles, three different flow intensities were considered, and trajectories of two different particle sizes, within the sand range were computed. Changes in particle rotation, particle velocity, and angle of trajectory before and after particle-particle collisions appear to be relatively important at lower shear stresses, whereas they decrease in significance with increasing flow intensities. Analyses of the evolution in time of the second order moment of particle location suggest that inter-particle collisions introduce transverse diffusion in saltating particles in the span-wise direction. {\textcopyright} 2012 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Wien.},

abstract = {Temporally and spatially averaged models of bedload transport are inadequate to describe the highly variable nature of particle motion at low transport stages. The primary sources of this variability are the resisting forces to downstream motion resulting from the geometrical relation (pocket friction angle) of a bed grain to the grains that it rests upon, variability of the near-bed turbulent velocity field and the local modification of this velocity field by upstream, protruding grains. A model of bedload transport is presented that captures these sources of variability by directly integrating the equations of motion of each particle of a simulated mixed grain-size sediment bed. Experimental data from the velocity field downstream and below the tops of upstream, protruding grains are presented. From these data, an empirical relation for the velocity modification resulting from upstream grains is provided to the bedload model. The temporal variability of near-bed turbulence is provided by a measured near-bed time series of velocity over a gravel bed. The distribution of pocket friction angles results as a consequence of directly calculating the initiation and cessation of motion of each particle as a result of the combination of fluid forcing and interaction with other particles. Calculations of bedload flux in a uniform boundary and simulated pocket friction angles agree favourably with previous studies.},

abstract = {In this study, we investigated the role of turbulence fluctuations on the entrainment of a fully exposed grain near threshold flow conditions. Experiments were carried out to measure synchronously the near bed flow velocity and the particle movement for a range of flow conditions and resulting particle entrainment frequencies. We used a simplified bed geometry consisted of spherical particles to reduce the complexities associated with the variations in the bed and flow details in an effort to identify the underlying dominant physical mechanism. An analysis was performed based on common force approximations using near bed flow velocity. Turbulence fluctuations were treated as impulses, which are products of magnitude and duration of applied force. It is demonstrated that besides the magnitude of the instantaneous forces applied on a sediment grain, their duration is important as well in determining whether a particle will be entrained by a turbulent flow event. Frequency of particle entrainment varied remarkably with minute changes in gross flow parameters. Impulse imparted on the sediment grain by turbulent flow was found to be well represented by a log-normal distribution. We obtained a (log-normal) probability density function (pdf) dependent on only the coefficient of variation of the impulse (impulse intensity). Relation of the impulse intensity to the particle Reynolds number, Re*, was established. The sensitivity of the computed impulse to the critical force level, as well as the influence of the critical impulse level on the dislodgement events, was explored. Particle entrainment probabilities were found using the derived pdf as well as experimental observations and a good agreement between the two is reported. Implications of the presented impulse concept and our experimental findings for sediment mobility at low bed shear stress conditions are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Drag on a bed sediment particle was measured using a force sensor in a laboratory flume. The applied flow velocity was also measured using particle image velocimetry. A quasi-steady spectral model is proposed to predict the spectra of drag force on the particle using point velocity data. The quantity CDA (where CD and A are the coefficient of drag and exposed area of the particle, respectively), which was determined experimentally, is used in the model owing to practical limitations in estimating appropriate values of the individual quantities (CD and A). The predicted spectrum is found to closely match the measured force spectrum up to 1 Hz, indicating the important role of low-frequency streamwise velocity fluctuations in generating quasi-steady drag force on the particle. The model highlights the significance of increased nonlinearity due to higher-order streamwise velocity fluctuations beyond 10 Hz. However, the nonlinearity due to shedding of vortices at higher frequencies is accounted for by coupling the model with an admittance function based on the exposure of the particle. The coupled model is found to perform satisfactorily for all exposures, except when the particle is flushed with the bed. The limitation of the quasi-steady model at lower exposures is also supported by poor correlation between the measured velocity and force time histories. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {Bedload transport in poorly sorted gravel bed streams is considered. Bedload and typical bed material (subpavement) size distributions are observed to be similar; it follows that the coarse half of the subpavement moves through a reach at a rate near that of the fine half. Since coarser grains are intrinsically less mobile than fine grains, it follows that some mechanism must act to nearly equalize mobility. It is hypothesized that the pavement seen in gravel bed streams at low flow is in fact in place during typical transport events capable of moving all available sizes. This pavement can provide the equalizing mechanism by exposing proportionally more coarse grains to the flow. Field data are used to quantify this concept and to develop a predictive relation for river pavement. The model indicates that pavement should be absent in most sand bed streams, in agreement with observation. Copyright 1982 by the American Geophysical Union.},

Miniature piezoelectric pressure sensors were used to capture the instantaneous pressure on the surface of the sphere. Movable ball experiments reveal the predominance of large sweep structures at the instant of entrainment. Fixed ball experiments carried out at entrainment conditions show the importance of both vertical and horizontal pressure gradients on the ball leading to entrainment.

abstract = {[1] Research examining the hydraulics, morphology, and stability of step-pool mountain streams has blossomed in the last decade, resulting in more than a dozen dissertations. These, along with other research projects, have transformed our understanding of step-pool channels. Contributions have been made toward understanding depositional step formation and destruction, scour downstream of steps, step-pool hydraulics, and the effect of sediment transport on step stability. We propose that depositional steps exist in a jammed state whereby the boulders are structurally arranged within the channel and thereby stabilize it. Once a step has formed, a scour pool with a characteristic length and depth develops downstream, creating a zone where additional steps are unlikely to occur. Downstream of the scour hole, steps are more likely to occur as the high energy associated with the plunge pool has dissipated. Data suggest that the presence of cobbles or boulders limits pool scour as well as the degree to which well-defined, channel-spanning step-pools form. We propose a state-space for step-pools in which conditions for a step to form include (1) the ratio between width and boulder diameter (the jamming ratio), (2) the ratio between applied shear stress and the stress needed to mobilize the bed (relative Shields number), and (3) the ratio between bed material supply and discharge (bed sediment concentration). Available data suggest this model is plausible. Emerging critical research questions are discussed. Copyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {We present a conceptually simple, flexible, and general framework for object instance segmentation. Our approach efficiently detects objects in an image while simultaneously generating a high-quality segmentation mask for each instance. The method, called Mask R-CNN, extends Faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting an object mask in parallel with the existing branch for bounding box recognition. Mask R-CNN is simple to train and adds only a small overhead to Faster R-CNN, running at 5 fps. Moreover, Mask R-CNN is easy to generalize to other tasks, e.g., allowing us to estimate human poses in the same framework. We show top results in all three tracks of the COCO suite of challenges, including instance segmentation, bounding-box object detection, and person keypoint detection. Without tricks, Mask R-CNN outperforms all existing, single-model entries on every task, including the COCO 2016 challenge winners. We hope our simple and effective approach will serve as a solid baseline and help ease future research in instance-level recognition. Code will be made available.},

abstract = {Riffle-pool sequences are maintained through the preferential entrainment of sediment grains from pools rather than riffles. This preferential entrainment has been attributed to a reversal in the magnitude of velocity and shear stress under high flows; however the Differential Sediment Entrainment Hypothesis (DSEH) postulates that differential entrainment can instead result from spatial sedimentological contrasts. Here we use a novel suite of in situ grain-scale field measurements from a riffle-pool sequence to parameterize a physically-based model of grain entrainment. Field measurements include pivoting angles, lift forces and high resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) acquired using terrestrial laser scanning, from which particle exposure, protrusion and surface roughness were derived. The entrainment model results show that grains in pools have a lower critical entrainment shear stress than grains in either pool exits or riffles. This is because pool grains have looser packing, hence greater exposure and lower pivoting angles. Conversely, riffle and pool exit grains have denser packing, lower exposure and higher pivoting angles. A cohesive matrix further stabilizes pool exit grains. The resulting predictions of critical entrainment shear stress for grains in different subunits are compared with spatial patterns of bed shear stress derived from a two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the reach. The CFD model predicts that, under bankfull conditions, pools experience lower shear stresses than riffles and pool exits. However, the difference in sediment entrainment shear stress is sufficiently large that sediment in pools is still more likely to be entrained than sediment in pool exits or riffles, resulting in differential entrainment under bankfull flows. Significantly, this differential entrainment does not require a reversal in flow velocities or shear stress, suggesting that sedimentological contrasts alone may be sufficient for the maintenance of riffle-pool sequences. This finding has implications for the prediction of sediment transport and the morphological evolution of gravel-bed rivers. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd..},

abstract = {A series of laboratory experiments demonstrates that riparian vegetation can cause a braided channel to self-organize to, and maintain, a dynamic, single-thread channel. The initial condition for the experiments was steady-state braiding in noncohesive sand under uniform discharge. From here, an experiment consisted of repeated cycles alternating a short duration high flow with a long duration low flow, and uniform dispersal of alfalfa seeds over the bed at the end of each high flow. Plants established on freshly deposited bars and areas of braidplain that were unoccupied during low flow. The presence of the plants had the effect of progressively focusing the high flow so that a single dominant channel developed. The single-thread channel self-adjusted to carry the high flow. Vegetation also slowed the rate of bank erosion. Matching of deposition along the point bar with erosion along the outer bend enabled the channel to develop sinuosity and migrate laterally while suppressing channel splitting and the creation of new channel width. The experimental channels spontaneously reproduced many of the mechanisms by which natural meandering channels migrate and maintain a single dominant channel, in particular bend growth and channel cutoff. In contrast with the braided system, where channel switching is a nearly continuous process, vegetation maintained a coherent channel until wholesale diversion of flow via cutoff and/or avulsion occurred, by which point the previous channel tended to be highly unfavorable for flow. Thus vegetation discouraged the coexistence of multiple channels. Varying discharge was key to allowing expression of feedbacks between the plants and the flow and promoting the transition from braiding to a single-thread channel that was then dynamically maintained. {\textcopyright} 2010 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {A nonhomogeneous discrete-time three-state Markov chain model is developed in this study to quantify the bedload and suspended load discharge under unsteady flow for mixed size sediment particles. When flow is subject to sudden changes, the particle holding time, defined as the amount of time for a sediment particle staying on the bed or in the moving state, needs to be carefully evaluated. The time step used in this study for single-step motion in the discrete-time Markov chain is represented by a characteristic timescale for particle motion. The transition probabilities are functions of flow conditions and particle properties. Specifically, the likelihood of particle movement between the bedload layer and the bed surface is evaluated by the entrainment probability. Exchange of sediment particles between the bedload layer and suspended load layer is quantified by the suspension probability. A nonhomogeneous Markov chain ensures the transition probabilities are time dependent as they are a function of local conditions. The proposed sediment transport model can be used to calculate both bedload and suspended load as a function of time for any size fraction of mixed size sediment particles. The proposed sediment transport relation is compared with a classic sediment transport formula. The comparison shows that the proposed model performs better for particles of smaller grain size. It is also demonstrated that the quasi-steady assumption normally adopted in flow-sediment modeling appears to be a valid approximation when the time for the sediment transport rate to reach an equilibrium state is sufficiently small. The proposed model is also validated against unsteady bedload transport flume data, as well as flume data containing both bedload and suspended load.},

abstract = {[1] In this study we incorporate the existing concept of fractional mobility into a stochastic framework for modeling the partial transport of mixed-size sediment. The model predicts the fractional transport rates with parameters such as the long-run moving probability, mean particle velocity, and fractional mobility, all varying with the dimensionless effective shear stress. Movement of bed load particles is treated as a random combination of single-step motions described by the pseudo four-state continuous-time Markov process whose long-run moving probability can be evaluated with the instantaneous entrainment probability and ratio of mean single-step holding time. A most updated version of entrainment probability taking into account both the rolling and lifting modes is adopted; the ratio of mean holding time is determined with a physically based relation derived experimentally. Two types of experiments are performed in this study: the colored bed experiments are carried out to observe the fractional mobility and partial transport; the plain bed experiments are conducted to observe the single-step bed load motions and mean particle velocity. The proposed model is widely tested with laboratory and field data pertaining to both partial and full transport conditions, and reasonably good agreement between the predicted and observed results is demonstrated. The model is then applied to evaluate the fractional mobility and explore the influence of sand content. The results reveal that the relation between fractional mobility and dimensionless effective shear stress is well approximated by the cumulative lognormal distribution, with its mean and standard deviation linearly decreasing with sand content for the range {\textless}0.34. The results imply that the existence of fine-grained sand in the gravelsand mixture is favorable to the mobilization of sediment. At higher sand content the condition of partial transport exists within a narrower range of flows such that full transport is easier to achieve. The present study is the first to investigate the effect of sand content on the fractional mobility, thus providing new insights into the process of partial transport.},

abstract = {Meandering rivers are common on Earth and other planetary surfaces, yet the conditions necessary to maintain meandering channels are unclear. As a consequence, self-maintaining meandering channels with cutoffs have not been reproduced in the laboratory. Such experimental channels are needed to explore mechanisms controlling migration rate, sinuosity, floodplain formation, and planform morphodynamics and to test theories for wavelength and bend propagation. Here we report an experiment in which meandering with near-constant width was maintained during repeated cutoff and regeneration of meander bends. We found that elevated bank strength (provided by alfalfa sprouts) relative to the cohesionless bed material and the blocking of troughs (chutes) in the lee of point bars via suspended sediment deposition were the necessary ingredients to successful meandering. Varying flood discharge was not necessary. Scaling analysis shows that the experimental meander migration was fast compared to most natural channels. This high migration rate caused nearly all of the bedload sediment to exchange laterally, such that bar growth was primarily dependent on bank sediment supplied from upstream lateral migration. The high migration rate may have contributed to the relatively low sinuosity of 1.19, and this suggests that to obtain much higher sinuosity experiments at this scale may have to be conducted for several years. Although patience is required to evolve them, these experimental channels offer the opportunity to explore several fundamental issues about river morphodynamics. Our results also suggest that sand supply may be an essential control in restoring self-maintaining, actively shifting gravel-bedded meanders.},

This paper describes morphologically similar stream reaches that are divided into 7 major stream type categories that differ in entrenchment, gradient, width/depth ratio, and sinuosity in various landforms. Within each major category are six additional types delineated by dominate channel materials from bedrock to silt/clay along a continuum of gradient ranges. Recent stream type data used to further define classification interrelationships were derived from 450 rivers throughout the U.S, Canada, and New Zealand. Data used in the development of this classification involved a great diversity of hydro-physiographic/geomorphic provinces from small to large rivers and in catchments from headwater streams in the mountains to the coastal plains. A stream hierarchical inventory system is presented which utilizes the stream classification system. Examples for use of this stream classification system for engineering, fish habitat enhancement, restoration and water resource management applications are presented. Specific examples of these applications include hydraulic geometry relations, sediment supply/availability, fish habitat structure evaluation, flow resistance, critical shear stress estimates, shear stress/velocity relations, streambank erodibility potential, management interpretations, sequences of morphological evolution, and river restoration principles. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

Four descriptors, including elongation, circularity, roundness, regularity, are chosen to characterize the particle shape. The considered container is discretized by a Voronoi tessellation with prescribed cell size and orientation distributions. Each Voronoi cell is then filledwith a particle with prescribed shape characteristics.

abstract = {Ideas deriving from the standard formulation for continuous time random walk (CTRW) based on the Montroll-Weiss Master Equation (ME) have been recently applied to transport and diffusion of river tracer pebbles. CTRW, accompanied by appropriate probability density functions (PDFs) for walker step length and waiting time, yields asymptotically the standard advection-diffusion equation (ADE) for thin-tailed PDFs and the fractional advection-diffusion equation (fADE) for heavy-tailed PDFs, the latter allowing the possibilities of subdiffusion or superdiffusion. Here we show that the CTRW ME is inappropriate for river pebbles moving as bed load: a deposited particle raises local bed elevation, and an entrained particle lowers it so that particles interact with the "lattice" of the sediment-water interface. We use the Parker-Paola-Leclair framework, which is a probabilistic formulation of the Exner equation of sediment conservation, to develop a new ME for tracer transport and dispersion for alluvial morphodynamics. The formulation is based on the existence of a mean bed elevation averaged over fluctuations. The new ME yields asymptotic forms for ADE and fADE that differ significantly from CTRW. It allows vertical as well as streamwise advection-diffusion. Vertical dispersion is nonlocal but cannot be expressed with fractional derivatives. In order to illustrate the new model, we apply it to the restricted case of vertical dispersion only, with both thin and heavy tails for relevant PDFs. Vertical dispersion shows a subdiffusive behavior.},

abstract = {This paper describes the relationship between the statistics of bed load transport flux and the timescale over which it is sampled. A stochastic formulation is developed for the probability distribution function of bed load transport flux, based on the Ancey et al. (2008) theory. An analytical solution for the variance of bed load transport flux over differing sampling timescales is presented. The solution demonstrates that the timescale dependence of the variance of bed load transport flux reduces to a three-regime relation demarcated by an intermittency timescale (tI) and a memory timescale (tc). As the sampling timescale increases, this variance passes through an intermittent stage (蠐tI), an invariant stage (tI {\textless} t {\textless} tc), and a memoryless stage (蠑 tc). We propose a dimensionless number (Ra) to represent the relative strength of fluctuation, which provides a common ground for comparison of fluctuation strength among different experiments, as well as different sampling timescales for each experiment. Our analysis indicates that correlated motion and the discrete nature of bed load particles are responsible for this three-regime behavior. We use the data from three experiments with high temporal resolution of bed load transport flux to validate the proposed three-regime behavior. The theoretical solution for the variance agrees well with all three sets of experimental data. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the observed fluctuations of bed load transport flux over monosize/multiple-size grain beds, to the characterization of an inherent connection between short-term measurements and long-term statistics, and to the design of appropriate sampling strategies for bed load transport flux.},

abstract = {This paper reports a stochastic model for the prediction of rollover movement probability of gravel particles in turbulent flow. The model is based on the data of a Direct Numerical Simulation of turbulent flow over a rough bed, which is represented by one layer uniform sphere particles. The locations of effective drag and lift forces are explored, as well as the ratio of drag and lift coefficients. The comparison between rollover and pickup probability models indicates that pickup model is valid for cases of critical shear stress less than 0.1 while rollover model works for critical shear stress larger than 0.1. Thus it is reasonable to take into consideration of both of the two models to predict sediment transport behavior in turbulent flows, especially for fluvial rivers which contain different kinds of sediment particles. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Association for Hydro-environment Engineering and Research, Asia Pacific Division.},

abstract = {A three-state continuous-time Markov chain is proposed to model the movement of sediment particles across three different states, i.e., bed material, bed load, and suspended load layer. The proposed model incorporates an exchange process between the bed load and the suspended load layer, in addition to the interface between the bed-load layer and the bed material, as normally considered in most of the existing sediment transport studies. In this study the mathematical treatment of the continuous-time Markov chain is clarified to stress the difference in definitions of the continuous-time and discrete-time Markov chains. With the employment of the continuous-time Markov model, the bed-load transport capacity in the long run and the time-varying transport rates can be derived. On the other hand, the threestate model can assist in distinguishing whether the flow is subject to significant suspended load or not. Furthermore, the distribution of particles in each of the three layers can be quantified. The proposed model is validated against natural river data. The comparison has shown a reasonably good agreement and thus the validity of the proposed model is confirmed. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Recent studies have presented evidence that PDFs of bed elevation and sediment transport rates depend on time scale (sampling time), but this dependence is not accounted for in any previous stochastic models. Here we propose an extension of Brownian motion, called fractional Laplace motion, as a model for sediment transport which acknowledges the fact that the time over which the gravel particles are in motion is in itself a random variable. We show that this model reproduces the multiscale statistics of sediment transport rates as quantified via a large-scale laboratory experiment. {\textcopyright} 2009 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {[1] A common approach for estimating the bed load transport rate in gravel-bed streams is to relate it to deterministic channel-averaged driving parameters and corresponding resistance properties of the bed material. Notwithstanding the proven success of this approach in modeling various morphodynamic scenarios, it does not contain the mechanics necessary to relate the bulk sediment transport rate to the displacement patterns of individual particles. Experiments on entrainment, transport, and deposition of tracer stones in a flume described here were designed to address this issue. Predictors of statistics of bed elevation fluctuations at short timescales, total and elevation-specific particle entrainment rates, particle step lengths, mean and associated probability density function for particle virtual velocity, and thickness of the active layer were developed. The working hypothesis tested in this paper is that the statistics of tracer displacements can be related to channel-averaged hydraulic parameters, and thus linked to macroscopic aspects of bed load transport.

abstract = {Mountain gravel-bed rivers typically display a surface layer that is armored. That is, the surface layer visible at low flow is coarser than both the substrate and mean annual bedload transported. The surface layer is difficult to sample at the high flows that transport most of the gravel. As a result, the question as to whether the surface layer remains armored at high flows is something of a mystery. The few measurements available suggest that some form of armoring may be in place at high flows as well. In lieu of more measurements, numerical modelling provides an avenue to explore this issue. Research results are presented using a 1D model of aggradation and degradation to mobile-bed equilibrium in gravel-bed streams. In the model, a hydrograph is cycled repeatedly so that water discharge goes up and down in time. The magnitude of the bedload feed rate and the size distribution of the feed material are, however, held constant at the upstream end of the reach. As a result, the final mobile-bed equilibrium attained is characterized by a bed at the upstream end of the reach that cyclically degrades and coarsens at high flow (when the sediment feed rate is not sufficient) and aggrades and becomes finer at low flow (when there is an excess of sediment feed). Only a short distance downstream, however, a remarkable tradeoff occurs. The bed adjusts so that over the great majority of the modelled reach the bed elevation and surface size distribution become invariant in time, hardly changing at all from low flow to high flow. The bedload transport rate and size distribution, however, fluctuate strongly with the hydrograph. That is, the higher flows support a higher transport rate of coarser material and the lower flows support a lower transport rate of finer material. The implication is that rivers subject to repeated hydrographs can evolve so that neither surface grain size distribution nor mean bed elevation (averaged over bars) need change much with flow, nearly all the variation being absorbed by the bedload. If this is true, it provides a most useful result; the surface grain size distribution seen at low flow may be very close to that seen at high flow. The results have been verified with two transport relations, that of Parker and that of Wilcock and Crowe. The reasons behind this simple result are explored in terms of a "hydrograph boundary layer," downstream of which the effect of the hydrograph on bed elevation and surface size distribution become negligible. The results of the numerical model also indicate that for a given hydrograph, the degree to which the surface is armored relative to the grain size distribution of the feed sediment decreases with increasing gravel feed rate. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Physical models of gravel braided rivers were used to investigate the adjustment of braiding intensity to step changes in channel-forming discharge and the mechanisms by which channel pattern adjustment and maintenance occurs. A braided channel developed at low discharge was subjected to two step increases in discharge between which the channel was given time to develop stable average braiding intensity in response to each steady discharge. Active (with visible bed material movement) and total channel networks were mapped throughout the experiment. Total braiding intensity exceeded active braiding intensity and both adjusted to a stable, average value at each discharge, indicating that channel pattern adjustment to total discharge involves both the active and the total network. Only portions of the total braided channel network developed at a given time, and it formed progressively by migration and avulsion of the (less extensive) active network. At equilibrium, the ratio of active to total braiding intensity stabilized at about 0.4. This stable value may increase with relative mobility of the bed material (stream power relative to grain size). The stable value was achieved via gradual increase of total braiding intensity while active braiding intensity adjusted very quickly to the increased flow. These adjustments are controlled by partial avulsion of the main active channel associated with changes in its sinuosity, and allocation of flow and bed load to secondary anabranches. Braided channel pattern dynamics is closely tied to, and explained by, the local dynamics and symmetry/asymmetry of bifurcations and avulsions. Copyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.},

The relationships for the vertical distribution of the total stress for the simplest case of 2d, steady, uniform, spatially averaged flow over a rough bed with flat free surface are derived. These relationships explicity include the form-induced stresses form drag as components of the total stress. Using this approach, we define three types of rough-bed flows: (1) Flow with high relative submergence; (2) flow with small relative submerged; and (3) flow over a partially inundated rough bed. The relationships for the double-averaged velocity distribution and hydraulic resistance for all three flow types are derived and compared with measurements where possible. The double-averaged turbulent and form-induced intensities and stresses for the case of regular spherical-segment-type roughness show the dominant role of the double-averaged turbulence stresses and form drag in momentum transfer in the near-bed region.},

abstract = {Previous analyses have identified the active width of braided rivers, the bed area over which bed load flux and short-term morphological change occurs, as an important element of braiding dynamics and predictions of bed load flux. Here we compare theoretical predictions of active width in gravel-bed braided rivers with observations from Sunwapta River, and from a generic physical model of gravel braided rivers, to provide general observations of the variation in active width, and to develop an understanding of the causes of variation. Bed topography was surveyed daily along a 150m reach of the pro-glacial Sunwapta River for a total of four weeks during summer when flow was above threshold for morphological activity. In the laboratory, detailed digital elevation models (DEMs) were derived from photogrammetric survey at regular intervals during a constant discharge run. From the field and flume observations there is considerable local and circumstantial variation in active width, but also a general trend in average active width with increasing discharge. There is also a clear relationship of active width with active braiding index (number of active branches in the braided channel network), and with dimensionless stream power, which appears to be consistent across the range of data from field and physical models. Thus there is a link between active width and the river morphology and dynamics, and the possibility of a general relationship for estimating active width from channel pattern properties or reach-scale stream power values, from which approximate bedload flux calculations may be made. The analysis also raises questions about differences between hydraulically-based numerical model computations of instantaneous active width and observation of time-integrated morphological active width. Understanding these differences can give insight into the nature of bedload transport in braided rivers and the relationship to morphological processes of braiding. {\textcopyright} 2011 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {An expert-based approach was used to identify 10 morphological unit types within a reach of the gravel bed, regulated Yuba River, California, that is heavily utilized by spawning Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Analysis of these units was carried out using two-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling, field-based geomorphic assessment, and detailed spawning surveying. Differently classified morphological units tended to exhibit discrete hydraulic signatures. In most cases, the Froude number adequately differentiated morphological units, but joint depth-velocity distributions proved the most effective hydraulic classification approach. Spawning activity was statistically differentiated at the mesoscale of the morphological unit. Salmon preferred lateral bar, riffle, and riffle entrance units. These units had moderately high velocity (unit median {\textgreater} 0.45 m s- 1) and low depth (unit median {\textless} 0.6 m), but each exhibited a unique joint depth-velocity distribution. A large proportion of redds (79{\%}) were associated with conditions of convective flow acceleration at riffle and riffle entrance locations. In addition to reflecting microhabitat requirements of fish, it was proposed that the hydraulic segregation of preferred from avoided or tolerated morphological units was linked to the mutual association of specific hydraulic conditions with suitable caliber sediment that promotes the provision and maintenance of spawning habitat. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Started from the basic Navier-Stokes equation, the velocity profile derivation was accomplished in a universal way for both smooth and rough open channel flows. However, the outcome of the derived theoretical equation shows that the smooth and rough bed flows give different boundary conditions due to the different formation of log law for smooth and rough bed cases in the inner region of velocity distribution.

abstract = {Dense gas-particle jets similar to collapsing eruption columns were generated by large-scale experiments. The column collapse resulted in a ground-hugging current forming stratified layers with bedding similar to natural pyroclastic density current deposits. At the impact of the collapsing column on the ground, a thick, massive bed was formed due to a high sedimentation rate that dumped turbulence due to high clast concentration. Down-current, flow expansion favoured turbulence and dilute gas-particle current that formed thin rippled layers deposited under traction. Experiments fed with fine ash (median size 0{\textperiodcentered}066 mm) formed deposits without tractional structures, because fine particles, as other sedimentary fine material, is cohesive and exposes a limited surface to the shear stress. Experimental outcomes show that massive beds are formed where the sedimentation rate per unit width Srw exceeds the bedload transportation rate Qb by two orders of magnitude. A lower ratio generates traction at the base of the flow and formation of shear structures that increase in wavelength and height with a decreasing flux. This study presents a diagram that provides a useful addition for facies analysis of pyroclastic density currents, provided that deposits representing sustained sedimentation can be identified in the field. In the diagram a decrease in the Srw/Qb ratio corresponds to an increase in bedform size. Application of the diagram for hazard assessment purposes allows the reconstruction of the mass eruption rate of the Agnano–Monte Spina eruption at Campi Flegrei, which is the main variable defining the intensity of past eruptions, and of the Bingham rheology of the massive underflow of the Mercato pyroclastic density current at Vesuvius.},

Specifically, we examine the "effect of normalization" of non-Gaussian noise by a linear system and the steady-state probability density function of particle velocity in the medium with Coulomb friction. Next, the general formulas for the probability distribution of the system perturbed by a non-Poisson $\delta$-pulse train are derived using an analysis of system trajectories between stimuli. As an example, overdamped particle motion in the bistable quadratic-cubic potential under the action of the periodic $\delta$-pulse train is analyzed in detail. The probability density function and the mean value of the particle position together with average characteristics of the first switching time from one stable state to another are found in the framework of the fast relaxation approximation.},

@article{Newson2000,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} Arnold 2000. The physical component of river channel (mstream) habitat is of acknowledged significance, particularly in headwater streams; furthermore, physical habitats have been heavily impacted by human needs for river services: principally flood defence (channel modification) and water resources (flow regulation). Despite the control exercised on physical habitats by fluvial geornorphology (channel shape, bed material size, bedforms and bars) and flow regime (including the varying hydraulics of flow around these forms), their interaction has hitherto lacked a distinctive spatial formulation and biological validation. This article describes the challenges faced by a need (in both theoretical and practical areas) to understand the detail of physical habitat conditions in stream channels. A number of mesoscale approaches are emerging, both from ecology and geomorphology. We outline the field validation of a 'habitat hydraulics' approach to the interaction between river discharge and channel form. Qualitative 'flow types' are shown to be representative of discrete hydraulic conditions within mesoscale units of the channel bed described as 'physical biotopes'. The approach is compared with parallel ecological research on 'rnesohabitats' and 'functional habitats'. The extent, pattern and discharge-variability of physical biotopes can be surveyed in the field and used as a spatial guide to biological sampling (in this case for benihic invertebrates). Biological patterns (at the scale sampled here) appear to respond first to the river continuum concept's longitudinal zonation of the channel, but there is a marked secondary signal in statistical analyses from the pattern of biotopes. Given the promise of the physical biotope approach, its logical extension in predictive mode is via the hierarchical concepts shared by freshwater ecologists and geomorphologists; however, there is little agreement or. scale terminology, hierarchical principles and, above all, a truly geomorphological channel classification, based on reaches, into which mesoscale habitat typologies could be fed. Assuming a relationship between biological diversity and that of physical biotopes it should be the aim of river managers, whether intervening in the channel form or its flow regime, to optimize certain parameters of the pattern of biotopes; these parameters should be a focus for future research. Both the rapid survey and proper description of these patterns will benefit from the application of remote-sensing technology, improved instruments for microscale hydraulic studies and a G1S approach based upon the spatial principles of landscape ecology.},

abstract = {Turbidity current and coastal storm deposits are commonly characterized by a basal sandy massive (structureless) unit overlying an erosional surface and underlying a parallel or cross-laminated unit. Similar sequences have been recently identified in fluvial settings as well. Notwithstanding field, laboratory and numerical studies, the mechanisms for emplacement of these massive basal units are still under debate. It is well accepted that the sequence considered here can be deposited by waning-energy flows, and that the parallel-laminated units are deposited under transport conditions corresponding to upper plane bed at the dune–antidune transition. Thus, transport conditions that are more intense than those at the dune–antidune transition should deposit massive units. This study presents experimental, open-channel flow results showing that sandy massive units can be the result of gradual deposition from a thick bedload layer of colliding grains called sheet flow layer. When this layer forms with relatively coarse sand, the non-dimensional bed shear stress associated with skin friction, the Shields number, is larger than a threshold value approximately equal to 0{\textperiodcentered}4. For values of the Shields number smaller than 0{\textperiodcentered}4 the sheet flow layer disappeared, sediment was transported by a standard bedload layer one or two grain diameters thick, and the bed configuration was characterized by downstream migrating antidunes and washed out dunes. Parallel laminae were found in deposits emplaced with standard bedload transport demonstrating that the same dilute flow can gradually deposit the basal and the parallel-laminated unit in presence of traction at the depositional boundary. Further, the experiments suggested that two different types of upper plane bed conditions can be defined, one associated with standard bedload transport at the dune–antidune transition, and the other associated with bedload transport in sheet flow mode at the transition between upstream and downstream migrating antidunes.},

Several other conclusions drawn for the case of a single grain on a fixed rough bed are: Angle of repose increases with decrease in size, departure from sphericity and increased angularity. Angle of repose increase with decrease in sorting. A single angle of repose for sand size grains is not valid.

abstract = {We show that a freshly sedimented granular bed settles and creeps forward over extended periods of time under an applied hydrodynamic shear stress which is below the critical value for bedload transport. The rearrangements are found to last over a timescale which is millions of times the sedimentation timescale of a grain in the fluid. Compaction occurs uniformly throughout the bed, but creep is observed to decay exponentially with depth and decreases over time. The granular volume fraction in the bed is found to increase logarithmically, saturating at the random close packing value $\phi$rcp≈0.64, while the surface roughness is observed to remain essentially unchanged. We demonstrate that an increasingly higher shear stress is required to erode the bed, after a subcritical shear is applied, which results in an increase in its volume fraction. Thus, we find that bed armoring occurs due to a deep shear-induced relaxation of the bed toward the volume fraction associated with the glass transition.},

abstract = {15 There is a wide variety of bed features that develop in gravel-bedded rivers that are smaller than 16 the channel-scale but larger than the individual grains. The features include gravel dunes, 17 bedload sheets, sandy bedforms developed over immobile gravel armor layers (sand ribbons, 18 barchans dunes, dunes with gaps in the troughs) and structural features of armor layers (clusters, 19 ribs and reticulate cells). We argue that with the exception of gravel dunes, the emergence of 20 these features is controlled by sediment supply and the differential mobility of grain size 21 distributions (equal, selective and partial mobility). Flow conditions play an important but 22 subsidiary role in the development of supply-limited bed features. We plot experimental data in 23 the phase space created by metrics of sediment supply and differential mobility and show the 24 different types of features appear in unique areas of the plot. Abstraction of the result to a phase 25 diagram reveals the inter-relations between bed features. The phase diagram provides a common 26 conceptual framework for studying supply-limited bed features in gravel-bedded rivers. 27 28},

abstract = {In natural flows, bed sediment particles are entrained and moved by the fluctuating forces, such as lift and drag, exerted by the overlying flow on the particles. To develop a better understanding of these forces and the relation of the forces to the local flow, the downstream and vertical components of force on near-bed fixed particles and of fluid velocity above or in front of them were measured synchronously at turbulence-resolving frequencies (200 or 500 Hz) in a laboratory flume. Measurements were made for a spherical test particle fixed at various heights above a smooth bed, above a smooth bed downstream of a downstream-facing step, and in a gravel bed of similarly sized particles as well as for a cubical test particle and 7 natural particles above a smooth bed. Horizontal force was well correlated with downstream velocity and not correlated with vertical velocity or vertical momentum flux. The standard drag formula worked well to predict the horizontal force, but the required value of the drag coefficient was significantly higher than generally used to model bed load motion. For the spheres, cubes, and natural particles, average drag coefficients were found to be 0.76, 1.36, and 0.91, respectively. For comparison, the drag coefficient for a sphere settling in still water at similar particle Reynolds numbers is only about 0.4. The variability of the horizontal force relative to its mean was strongly increased by the presence of the step and the gravel bed. Peak deviations were about 30{\%} of the mean force for the sphere over the smooth bed, about twice the mean with the step, and 4 times it for the sphere protruding roughly half its diameter above the gravel bed. Vertical force correlated poorly with downstream velocity, vertical velocity, and vertical momentum flux whether measured over or ahead of the test particle. Typical formulas for shear-induced lift based on Bernoulli's principle poorly predict the vertical forces on near-bed particles. The measurements suggest that particle-scale pressure variations associated with turbulence are significant in the particle momentum balance. Copyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union.},

The spatial scales used were significantly larger than the particle size, while the temporal scales covered a two-orders-of-magnitude range enabling the physical time scales of the single particles to be appreciated.

abstract = {The ideas of advection and diffusion of sediment particles are probabilistic constructs that emerge when the Master equation, a precise, probabilistic description of particle conservation, is approximated as a Fokker–Planck equation. The diffusive term approximates nonlocal transport. It ‘looks' upstream and downstream for variations in particle activity and velocities, whose effects modify the advective term. High-resolution measurements of bedload particle motions indicate that the mean squared displacement of tracer particles, when treated as a virtual plume, primarily reflects a nonlinear increase in the variance in hop distances with increasing travel time, manifest as apparent anomalous diffusion. In contrast, an ensemble calculation of the mean squared displacement involving paired coordinate positions independent of starting time indicates a transition from correlated random walks to normal (Fickian) diffusion. This normal behavior also is reflected in the particle velocity autocorrelation function. Spatial variations in particle entrainment produce a flux from sites of high entrainment toward sites of low entrainment. In the case of rain splash transport, this leads to topographic roughening, where differential rain splash beneath the canopy of a desert shrub contributes to the growth of a soil mound beneath the shrub. With uniform entrainment, rain splash transport, often described as a diffusive process, actually represents an advective particle flux that is proportional to the land surface slope. Particle diffusion during both bedload and rain splash transport involves motions that mostly are patchy, intermittent and rarefied. The probabilistic framework of the Master equation reveals that continuous formulations of the flux and its divergence (the Exner equation) represent statistically expected behavior, analogous to Reynolds-averaged conditions. Key topics meriting clarification include the mechanical basis of particle diffusion, effects of rarefied conditions involving patchy, intermittent motions, and effects of rest times on diffusion of tracer particles and particle-borne substances.

abstract = {The motion of isolated heavy particles on the bottom wall of a turbulent shear flow is investigated experimentally (using high-frequency particle tracking) and correlated to that of the fluid (from high-resolution LDV measurements). Numerous particle diameters, particle densities, and flow velocities are considered, where the particles remain within the viscous sublayer (particle Reynolds number lower than 10). It is shown that fluid flow fluctuations within the viscous sublayer (varying Couette flow) induce particle velocity fluctuations of the same magnitude, slightly smaller. The mean particle velocity, standard deviation, and Lagrangian correlation time are found to scale with the viscous scales. Particles roll and slide without takeoff, unlike what happens in viscous laminar flow where the lift force may overcome the immersed particle weight. Arguments are given for this difference. Probability density functions for the streamwise and spanwise velocity are found to follow Gamma and Gaussian laws, respectively, which also scale with the viscous scales.},

Critical flow conditions are then predicted by equating the lower extremes in these characteristic critical shear stress distributions to the upper extremes in the distribution of instantaneous bed shear stress produced by the particular type of background flow under consideration. The method is applied to the case of two-dimensional channel flow over a flat bed and yields sufficiently consistent results to suggest an extension to Shields' curve for small grain Reynolds numbers.

abstract = {A new method for efficient discretization of random fields (i.e., their representation in terms of random variables) is introduced. The efficiency of the discretization is measured by the number of random variables required to represent the field with a specified level of accuracy. The method is based on principles of optimal linear estimation theory. It represents the field as a linear function of nodal random variables and a set of shape functions, which are determined by minimizing an error variance. Further efficiency is achieved by spectral decomposition of the nodal covariance matrix. The new method is found to be more efficient than other existing discretization methods, and more practical than a series expansion method employing the Karhunen-Loeve theorem. The method is particularly useful for stochastic finite element studies involving random media, where there is a need to reduce the number of random variables so that the amount of required computations can be reduced. {\textcopyright} ASCE.},

@article{Sayre1965,
abstract = {One significant facet of the disposal of radioactive wastes in alluvial streams pertains to the influence that natural sediments have on the transport and dispersion of radioactive wastes. The sorption of radioactive wastes by clay, silt, and sand (par ticularly clay-coated sand) is a common phenomenon; hence, the transport and dispersion of waste can be affected to a significant extent by the transport and dispersion of the individual sediment particles. To study the transport and dispersion of bed-material particles (sand), an experiment was conducted in the North Loup River near Purdum, Nebr. In the experiment, sand labeled with radioactive iridium 192 was released from a line source on the bed of the river. After release, the movement of the tracer particles downstream was observed by monitoring the streambed with a sled-mounted scintillation detector. In addition, the vertical distribution of the tracer particles in the bed was observed by monitoring core samples of the bed material. The amount of activity and the number of tracer particles used in the experiment were determined from detailed calibrations in which field conditions were simulated. The tracer particles varied within a fairly narrow range about a median fall diameter of 0.305 mm. The size of the tracer particles was selected so that they would be slightly coarser than the dominant size range of the bed material. Longitudinal traverses with the radiation detection equipment at approximately daily intervals and extending over a 13-day period defined the dispersion of tracer particles along the channel. The traverses also indicated that some of the tracer particles were buried as a concentrated deposit for about 7 days. Presumably, these tracer particles were deposited in an unusually deep dune trough and were not reexposed until a similarly deep trough passed by. The tem porary burial of the tracer particles demonstrates that deposits of contaminated particles in an alluvial stream can remain un disturbed for relatively long periods of time and then suddenly be released. A concentration-distribution function, which is based on probability theory, was derived to characterize the dispersion process. The parameters of the function are related to the dispersion time and distance. Significant characteristics of the function are that the variance and the mean of the distribution are proportional to time and that for large times the maximum concentration varies inversely with the square root of time. Comparable observed and theoretical distributions agreed well except near the origin and at the downstream tail. The explana tion for the differences is based on certain discrepancies betweenphysical features of the experiment and the corresponding assumptions on which the theoretical distribution function is based. The major discrepancy is that the theory applies only to a group of tracer particles having identical transport character istics, whereas the tracer particles did not all have the same characteristics. In addition to defining the dispersion of particles, the observed distribution curves provided information for computing the bed material discharge. The computation of discharge was made with a continuity-type equation, which states simply that the discharge is the product of the mean velocity of the particles and the cross-sectional area through which they move. Although a direct comparison of the computed discharge and a measured discharge could not be made, the computed discharge compared favorably with the discharge computed by the modified Einstein procedure. Although the concentration-distribution function was derived for the initial conditions of a vertical-plane source, it can be extended to more complex conditions by performing appropriate mathematical operations. In addition, the function can be applied to real situations if the constants in the concentration distribution function and the depth of the zone of particle movement in the bed are known. When the bed configuration consists of dunes or ripples, the depth of the zone of particle movement can be estimated from longitudinal profiles of the bed surface. However, until the relations between hydraulic and sediment parameters and the constants in the theoretical dis tribution function are defined, the constants can be evaluated only by experiment.},

@article{Heyman2013,
abstract = {Steep slope streams show large fluctuations of sediment discharge across several time scales. These fluctuations may be inherent to the internal dynamics of the sediment transport process. A probabilistic framework thus seems appropriate to analyze such a process. In this paper, we present an experimental study of bedload transport over a steep slope flume for small to moderate Shields numbers. The sampling technique allows the acquisition of high-resolution time series of the solid discharge. The resolved time scales range from 10-1 s up to 105 s. We show that two distinct time scales can be observed in the probability density function for the waiting time between moving particles. We make the point that the separation of time scales is related to collective dynamics. Proper statistics of a Markov process including collective entrainment are derived. The separation of time scales is recovered theoretically for low entrainment rates. {\textcopyright} 2013. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.},

The experiments were done in a low submergence condition. Measurements revealed that the vertical distribution of streamwise flow velocity at the instant of entrainment is significantly different from the temporal mean flow profile. The role of turbulence for a given flow depth is found to decrease with an increase in exposure of the particle. An expression for threshold velocity is proposed that accurately represents the enhanced near-bed turbulence during entrainment. A Shields-type parameter, expressed in terms of critical near-bed flow velocity rather than shear velocity, is used to define the sediment transport threshold. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

They are constructed by particles moving from less stable positions into more stable configurations against each other. Intermediate developments include clusters and stone lines.

abstract = {This paper summarizes the results of an experimental study on the influence of an external turbulence field on the bed load sediment transport in an open channel. The external turbulence was generated by (1) a horizontal pipe placed halfway through the depth h; (2) a series of grids with a clearance of about one-third of the depth from the bed, and extending over a finite length of the flume; and (3) a series of grids with a clearance in the range (0.1 - 1.0)h from the bed, but extending over the entire length of the flume. Two kinds of experiments were conducted: plane-bed experiments and ripple-covered-bed experiments. In the former case, the flow in the presence of the turbulence generator was adjusted so that the mean bed shear stress was the same as in the case without the turbulence generator in order to single out the effect of the external turbulence on the sediment transport. In the ripple-covered-bed case, the mean and turbulence quantities of the streamwise component of the velocity were measured, and the Shields parameter, due to skin friction, was determined. The Shields parameter, together with the RMS value of the streamwise velocity fluctuations, was correlated with the sediment transport rate. The sediment transport increases markedly with increasing turbulence level.},

abstract = {This study addresses the rolling and lifting probabilities for sediment entrainment by incorporating the probabilistic features of the turbulent fluctuation and bed grain geometry. The lognormally distributed instantaneous velocity and uniformly distributed initial grain position, along with a relation between lift coefficient and particle Reynolds number, are used to extend the theoretical formulation of the entrainment probabilities in smooth-bed flows. The two threshold conditions identified herein enable us to precisely define the probabilities of entrainment in the rolling and lifting modes. The results obtained in this study coincide well with the published data. The lifting probability increases monotonously with the dimensionless shear stress $\theta$, which is consistent with the earlier results yet displays improved agreement with the experimental data. The maximum value of rolling probability, with a magnitude of $\theta$ 0.25, occurs at $\theta$ ≈ 0.15. For $\theta$ {\textless}0.05 (or $\theta$ {\textgreater}0.6), the rolling (or lifting) probability makes up more than 90{\%} of the total entrainment probability and thus can be used as an approximation to the total probability of entrainment. The proposed rolling and lifting probabilities are further linked to the two separate criteria for incipient motion to explore the critical entrainment probabilities. The results reveal that a consistent probability corresponding to the critical state of sediment entrainment cannot be found.},

abstract = {The beds of gravel-bed rivers commonly display distinct sorting patterns, which at length scales of {\~{}}. 0.1. 1 channel widths appear to form an organization of patches or facies. This paper explores alternatives to traditional visual facies mapping by investigating methods of patch delineation in which clustering analysis is applied to a high-resolution grid of spatial grain-size distributions (GSDs) collected during a flume experiment. Specifically, we examine four clustering techniques: 1) partitional clustering of grain-size distributions with the k-means algorithm (assigning each GSD to a type of patch based solely on its distribution characteristics), 2) spatially-constrained agglomerative clustering ("growing" patches by merging adjacent GSDs, thus generating a hierarchical structure of patchiness), 3) spectral clustering using Normalized Cuts (using the spatial distance between GSDs and the distribution characteristics to generate a matrix describing the similarity between all GSDs, and using the eigenvalues of this matrix to divide the bed into patches), and 4) fuzzy clustering with the fuzzy c-means algorithm (assigning each GSD a membership probability to every patch type). For each clustering method, we calculate metrics describing how well-separated cluster-average GSDs are and how patches are arranged in space. We use these metrics to compute optimal clustering parameters, to compare the clustering methods against each other, and to compare clustering results with patches mapped visually during the flume experiment.All clustering methods produced better-separated patch GSDs than the visually-delineated patches. Although they do not produce crisp cluster assignment, fuzzy algorithms provide useful information that can characterize the uncertainty of a location on the bed belonging to any particular type of patch, and they can be used to characterize zones of transition from one patch to another. The extent to which spatial information influences clustering leads to a trade-off between the quality of GSD separation between patch types and the spatial coherence of patches. Methods incorporating spatial information during the clustering process tended to produce a finite number of types of patches. As methods improve for collecting high-resolution grain size data, the approaches described here can be scaled up to field studies to better characterize the grain size heterogeneity of river beds. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Numerical models in geomorphology and geophysics can be arranged along a continuum with ‘simulation models' at one end and highly simplified, ‘exploratory models' at the other. Simulation models are designed to reproduce a natural system as completely as possible; to simulate as wide a range of behaviors, in as much detail, and with as much quantitative accuracy as can be achieved. To accomplish this goal, a modeler typically strives to include all the processes that could significantly affect the quantitative accuracy of the model, and typically treats the processes in as much detail as is practical. In this case, model evaluation naturally consists of quantitatively comparing predicted variable values to corresponding measurements made in the field or laboratory. At the other end of this model spectrum, exploratory models arise when trying to discover what processes or interactions produce some poorly understood phenomenon-when searching for the clearest, simplest explanation. In this case, a modeler strives to include as few processes as possible while reproducing the poorly understood aspects of the phenomenon in question, to find the essential mechanisms. In exploratory models, quantitative accuracy is not as important as simplifying the formalism to investigate the general features of the interactions and feedbacks capable of causing a poorly understood behavior; a quantitatively accurate match with a wide variety of observations may not be expected. As with simulation models, a quantitative match with specific observations may be achievable by tuning parameters and the form of model interactions. However, a better model-testing strategy in these cases involves robust predictions that do not depend on the details of the formal representations of processes in the model, but result inevitably from the most general aspects of the model interactions. Testing such predictions can falsify the basic hypotheses the model is designed to explore.},

abstract = {Particles transported as bed load within a specified streambed area possess at any instant a distribution of velocities. This distribution figures prominently in describing the rates of transport and dispersal of particles. High-speed imaging of sand particles transported as bed load over a planar bed reveals that the probability density functions of the streamwise and cross-stream particle velocities are exponential-like. For quasi-steady conditions the exponential-like density of streamwise velocities reflects a balance among three fluxes in momentum space: (1) an advection of streamwise momentum whose magnitude and sign vary with the momentum state; (2) a diffusion of momentum from higher to lower values of momentum density; and (3) a drift of momentum from regions in momentum space having high average rates of generation of kinetic energy toward regions having low rates of generation of kinetic energy. The probability density of cross-stream velocities similarly reflects a balance of fluxes of cross-stream momentum. Whereas the average net force acting on particles is zero under steady conditions, the mean, variance and asymmetry of the distribution of forces acting on particles vary with the momentum state of the particles. Numerical simulations of particle motions that are faithful to these statistical properties reproduce key empirical results, namely, the exponential-like velocity distribution and the nonlinear relation between hop distances and travel times. The simulations also illustrate how steady gradients in particle activity, the solid volume of particles in motion per unit streambed area, induce a diffusive flux as described in companion papers. {\textcopyright} 2012.

abstract = {Experiments are reported on the dynamics of a bed of particles sheared by a viscous Couette flow in an annular channel, with emphasis on the distributions of particle velocities, durations and lengths of the small saltation flights, and surface density of the moving particles. The velocity distributions are shown to decay approximately exponentially, with mean value, Up, equal to 0.1 $\gamma$d, where $\gamma$ is the shear rate and d is the particle diameter. The duration of the flights does not depend on the shear rate, and is equal to 15 times the settling time d/Vs, where Vs is the Stokes settling velocity. Starting from an initially loosely packed bed, the surface density of the moving particles, Np, was observed to decrease slowly over several days, unlike their velocity which remains constant with time. This decay is related to the increase of the threshold shear rate for particle motion, and corresponds to rearrangement of the particles near the bed surface (armouring). When the stationary state is reached, Np depends linearly on the shear rate, so that the particle flow rate, Qp = N p Up, is a quadratic function of the shear rate. Two theoretical models are proposed to account for these observations. In the first one, the erosion and deposition rates are modelled using the two hydrodynamic time scales: the inverse shear rate $\gamma$-1 for the erosion rate, and the settling time d/V s for the deposition rate. This model accounts for the linear dependence of Np on the shear rate. The second model was developed to capture the slow decrease of Np, by considering the trapping of moving particles into troughs of the bed. This trapping model does recover the main features observed experimentally, although the characteristic time for the decrease of N p still remains too short. Our observations are, finally, compared to existing numerical and experimental studies on turbulent flows. {\textcopyright} 2004 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {We investigate the entrainment, deposition and motion of coarse spherical particles within a turbulent shallow water stream down a steep slope. This is an idealization of bed-load transport in mountain streams. Earlier investigations have described this kind of sediment transport using empirical correlations or concepts borrowed from continuum mechanics. The intermittent character of particle transport at low-water discharges led us to consider it as a random process. Sediment transport in this regime results from the imbalance between entrainment and deposition of particles rather than from momentum balance between water and particles. We develop a birth-death immigration-emigration Markov process to describe the particle exchanges between the bed and the water stream. A key feature of the model is its long autocorrelation times and wide, frequent fluctuations in the solid discharge, a phenomenon never previously explained despite its ubiquity in both nature and laboratory experiments. We present experimental data obtained using a nearly two-dimensional channel and glass beads as a substitute for sediment. Entrainment, trajectories, and deposition were monitored using a high-speed digital camera. The empirical probability distributions of the solid discharge and deposition frequency were properly described by the theoretical model. Experiments confirmed the existence of wide and frequent fluctuations of the solid discharge, and revealed the existence of long autocorrelation time, but theory overestimates the autocorrelation times by a factor of around three. Particle velocity was weakly dependent on the fluid velocity contrary to the predictions of the theoretical model, which performs well when a single particle is moving. For our experiments, the dependence of the solid discharge on the fluid velocity is entirely controlled by the number of moving particles rather than by their velocity. We also noted significant changes in the behaviour of particle transport when the bed slope or the water discharge was increased. The more vigorous the stream was, the more continuous the solid discharge became. Moreover, although 90{\%} of the energy supplied by gravity to the stream is dissipated by turbulence for slopes lower than 10{\%}, particles dissipate more and more energy when the bed slope is increased, but surprisingly, the dissipation rate is nearly independent of fluid velocity. A movie is available with the online version of the paper. {\textcopyright} 2008 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {The distinct element method is a numerical model capable of describing the mechanical behaviour of assemblies of discs and spheres. The method is based on the use of an explicit numerical scheme in which the interaction of the particles is monitored contact by contact and the motion of the particles modelled particle by particle. The main features of the distinct element method are described. The method is validated by comparing force vector plots obtained from the computer program BALL with the corresponding plots obtained from a photoelastic analysis. The photoelastic analysis used for the comparison is the one applied to an assembly of discs by De Josselin de Jong and Verruijt (1969). The force vector diagrams obtained numerically closely resemble those obtained photoelastically. It is concluded from this comparison that the distinct element method and the program BALL are valid tools for research into the behaviour of granular assemblies. {\textcopyright} 1979, Thomas Telford Ltd.

abstract = {High-speed imaging of coarse sand particles transported as bed load over a planar bed reveals that the particle activity, the solid volume of particles in motion per unit streambed area, fluctuates as particles respond to near-bed fluid turbulence while simultaneously interacting with the bed. The relative magnitude of these fluctuations systematically varies with the size of the sampling area. The particle activity within a specified sampling area is distributed in a manner that is consistent with the existence of an ensemble of configurations of particle positions wherein certain configurations are preferentially selected or excluded by the turbulence structure, manifest as patchiness of active particles. The particle activity increases with increasing bed stress far faster than does the average particle velocity, so changes in the transport rate with changing stress are dominated by changes in the activity, not velocity. The probability density functions of the streamwise and cross-stream particle velocities are exponential-like and lack heavy tails. Plots of the mean squared particle displacement versus time may ostensibly indicate non-Fickian diffusive behavior while actually reflecting effects of correlated random walks associated with intrinsic periodicities in particle motions, not anomalous diffusion. The probability density functions of the particle hop distance (start-to-stop) and the associated travel time are gamma-like, which provides the empirical basis for showing that particle disentrainment rates vary with hop distance and travel time. {\textcopyright} 2012.

@article{Elhakeem2016,
abstract = {In this study, a bedload model for nonuniform sediment is developed considering the density function of sediment entrainment with no active layer. The model is formulated based on physical considerations, dimensional reasoning, regression analysis, and laboratory data. Four parameters are incorporated in the model formulation, namely the Shields stress $\tau$*g', the critical Shields stress $\tau$*cg, the Kramer coefficient of uniformity cu, and the relative grain size (size of the jth grain fraction to the geometric mean size, dj/dg). The model collectively accounts for the hiding effects and the variation of the transported bedload material fractions from the surface and subsurface material. The findings of the study show that at low values of $\tau$*g'/$\tau$*cg fractions within the range of 0.3 {\textless} dj/dg {\textless} 3.0 are present with larger amounts in the transported bedload material than in the substrate, whereas fractions finer or coarser than that range are present with larger amounts in the surface layer than in the substrate. The study shows also that only fractions of dj/dg {\textgreater} 3.0 could contribute to the formation of the armor layer, whereas fractions close to the geometric mean value would contribute the most to the bedload transport rate at low values of $\tau$*g'/$\tau$*cg. The armor layer would completely obliterate at high values of $\tau$*g'/$\tau$*cg {\textgreater} 3.5. Further, the model provides more insight in the expected errors in the predictions of both the substrate-based and surface-based models. Model results show that errors in the predictions of some fractions in the sediment mixture can be as large as 100{\%} and 350{\%} for the substrate-based and surface-based models, respectively. For both types of models, the errors were obvious at low shear stresses and decline with the increase of $\tau$*g'/$\tau$*cg. By comparing the predictions of selected models with measured bedload data, it has been found that the proposed bedload model provides better predictions over the other models examined herein, highlighting the importance of considering the interaction between the surface and subsurface material when estimating the bedload rate material.},

@article{Kirchener1990,
abstract = {The erodibility of a grain on a rough bed is controlled by, among other factors, its relative projection above the mean bed, its exposure relative to upstream grains, and its friction angle. Here we report direct measurements of friction angles, grain projection and exposure, and small‐scale topographic structure on a variety of water‐worked mixed‐grain sediment surfaces. Using a simple analytical model of the force balance on individual grains, we calculate the distribution of critical shear stress for idealized spherical grains on the measured bed topography. The friction angle, projection, and exposure of single grain sizes vary widely from point to point within a given bed surface; the variability within a single surface often exceeds the difference between the mean values of disparate surfaces. As a result, the critical shear stress for a given grain size on a sediment surface is characterized by a probability distribution, rather than a single value. On a given bed, the crtitical shear stress distributions of different grain sizes have similar lower bounds, but above their lower tails they diverge rapidly, with smaller grains having substantially higher median critical shear stresses. Large numbers of fines, trapp.ed within pockets on the bed or shielded by upstream grains, are effectively lost to the flow. Our calculations suggest that critical shear stress, as conventionally measured, is defined by the most erodible grains, entrained during transient shear stress excursions associated with the turbulent flow; this implies a physical basis for the indeterminacy of initial motion. These observations suggest that transport rate/shear stress relationships may be controlled, in part, by the increasing numbers of grains that become available for entrainment as mean shear stress increases. They also suggest that bed textures and grain size distributions may be controlled, within the constraints of an imposed shear stress and sediment supply regime, by the influence of each size fraction on the erodibility of other grain sizes present on the bed.

The outcome appears to indicate that the pickup probabilities resulting from the two mathematical methods are of the same order of accuracy if the optimal lift coefficients are used. The error analysis implies that the results for the log-normal distribution reveal a significant improvement of accuracy over that for the normal distribution.

abstract = {Particle shape is a key to the space-filling and strength properties of granular matter. We consider a shape parameter $\eta$ describing the degree of distortion from a perfectly spherical shape. Encompassing most specific shape characteristics such as elongation, angularity and non-convexity, $\eta$ is a low-order but generic parameter that we used in a numerical benchmark test for a systematic investigation of shape dependence in sheared granular packings composed of particles of different shapes. We find that the shear strength is an increasing function of $\eta$ with nearly the same trend for all shapes, the differences appearing thus to be of second order compared to $\eta$. We also observe a non-trivial behavior of packing fraction which, for all our simulated shapes, increases with $\eta$ from the random close packing fraction for disks, reaches a peak considerably higher than that for disks, and subsequently declines as $\eta$ is further increased. These findings suggest that a low-order description of particle shape accounts for the principal trends of packing fraction and shear strength. Hence, the effect of second-order shape parameters may be investigated by considering different shapes at the same level of $\eta$. {\textcopyright} 2012 Europhysics Letters Association.},

abstract = {The problem of determining the threshold of motion of a sediment particle resting on the bed of an open channel has historically been dominated by an approach based on the time-space-averaged bed shear stress (i.e. Shields criterion). Recently, experimental studies have promoted an alternative approach to predict the dislodgement threshold, which is based on the impulse of the flow-induced force. Nonetheless, theoretical analyses accompanying these studies result in complex expressions that fail to provide a direct estimate of said impulse threshold. We employ the work-energy principle to derive a prediction of the fundamental impulse threshold that the destabilising hydrodynamic force must overcome in order to achieve full particle dislodgement. For the bed configuration studied, which is composed of spheres, the proposed expression depends on the mobile particle's size and mass, and shows excellent agreement with experimental observations previously published. The derivation presented in this paper may thus represent a robust theoretical framework that aids in the reinterpretation of existing data, as well as in the design of future experiments aimed at analysing the importance of hydrodynamic impulse as a criterion for prediction of particle dislodgement.},

abstract = {We describe the most likely forms of the probability distributions of bed load particle velocities, accelerations, hop distances, and travel times, in a manner that formally appeals to inferential statistics while honoring mechanical and kinematic constraints imposed by equilibrium transport conditions. The analysis is based on E. Jaynes's elaboration of the implications of the similarity between the Gibbs entropy in statistical mechanics and the Shannon entropy in information theory. By maximizing the information entropy of a distribution subject to known constraints on its moments, our choice of the form of the distribution is unbiased. The analysis suggests that particle velocities and travel times are exponentially distributed and that particle accelerations follow a Laplace distribution with zero mean. Particle hop distances, viewed alone, ought to be distributed exponentially. However, the covariance between hop distances and travel times precludes this result. Instead, the covariance structure suggests that hop distances follow a Weibull distribution. These distributions are consistent with high-resolution measurements obtained from high-speed imaging of bed load particle motions. The analysis brings us closer to choosing distributions based on our mechanical insight.},

After a series of quasi‐stationary alternate bars were formed under equilibrium sediment transport, feed rate was reduced in two steps to one third and one tenth the initial rate as discharge was held constant. The primary response following both reductions was an increase in bed surface particle size as a corridor of intensive bed load transport contracted and local transport rates decreased. After the first feed rate reduction, the channel incised by twice the mean water depth, on average, and caused distal bar surfaces to emerge as terracelike features. Bar roughness decreased, and mean boundary shear stress exerted on bed surface particles increased. Little incision occurred after the second feed rate reduction.

In this way wake-like piles of coarse particles accumulate in front of the obstacle which stopped them. "Pebble clusters" offer excellent indications of the direction of the current, because they are always parallel, or nearly so, to the direction of the current and because the wake is almost always upstream and the boulder downstream. Furthermore, their presence in conglomerates of unknown origin offers evidence of unidirectional transport and excludes beach deposits. Finally, "pebble clusters" are also a clue to the mode of deposition of the particles; clusters require selective transport rather than mass transport. {\textcopyright} 1968.},

The turbulence mechanism in the flow above the bed plays a most significant role in the analysis of rate of bed‐load movement.

abstract = {Excess sediment production in the upper parts of catchments may result in important impacts over morphodynamics of gravel bed-rivers. By changing morphodynamics, sediment overfeeding may induce important changes in the structure of near-bed flow, mainly in what concerns exchange of momentum and mass between flow within the roughness elements and flow in the upper regions. It is not well-known how turbulent statistics, including those characterizing the bursting cycle, are affected by bed load transport, for mobile but geometrically similar beds. This study addresses this issue. It is aimed at evaluating the impacts of sediment transport on flow hydrodynamics, namely on statistics of turbulent coherent structures. In order to accomplish the proposed objective, laboratory tests were undertaken. Two-dimensional instantaneous flow velocity fields in the stream-wise and vertical directions were measured with Particle Image Velocimetry. Two laboratory tests simulated a framework gravel bed with sand matrix and a framework gravel bed with sand matrix but with sediment transport imposed at near capacity conditions. The framework consists of coarse gravel whose diameters range between 0.5 cm and 7 cm and is kept immobile under the imposed flow conditions. The mobile sediments are sand with a mean diameter of 0.9 mm. For both tests, the quadrant threshold analysis technique was employed and shear stress distribution statistics were analyzed and discussed in what concerns their contribution and persistence. In the case of mobile conditions, sweep events tend to govern the flow in the near-bed region. Relevant differences between mobile and sub-threshold beds are found in the wake of roughness elements, mostly for sweep statistics. In the presence of bed-load, ejection events decrease their participation in the shear stress production processes. This decrease in the ejection events contribution is partially balanced with an increase in the frequency of inward events. {\textcopyright} 2014 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, London.},

Using transport simulations for a wide range of driving conditions, we show that the scaling depends on the manner in which the kinetic fluctuation energy of transported particles is dissipated: via predominantly fluid drag and quasistatic contacts (linear) versus fluid drag and quasistatic and collisional contacts (nonlinear). We use this finding to derive a scaling law (asymptotically Q∼$\tau$2) in simultaneous agreement with measurements in water and air streams.},

abstract = {Motion pictures taken a t Duck Creek, a clear stream 6.5 m wide and 35 cm deep near Pinedale, Wyoming, provide detailed, quantitative information on both the modes of motion of individual bedload particles and the collective motions of large numbers of them. Bed shear stress was approximately 6 Pa (60 dynes cm-2)w, hich was about twice the threshold for movement of the 4mm median diameter fine gravel bed material ; and transport was almost entirely as bedload. The displacements of individual particles occurred mainly by rolling of the majority of the particles and saltation of the smallest ones, and rarely by brief sliding of large, angular ones. Entrainment was principally by rollover of the larger particles and liftoff of the smaller ones, and infrequently by ejection caused by impacts, whereas distrainment was primarily by diminution of fluid forces in the case of rolling particles and by collisions with larger bed particles in the case of saltating ones. The displacement times averaged about 0.2–0.4 s and generally were much shorter than the intervening repose times. The collective motions of the particles were characterized by frequent, brief, localized, random sweep- transport events of very high rates of entrainment and transport, which in the aggregate transported approximately 70{\%} of the total load moved. These events occurred 9 {\%} of the time a t any particular point of the bed, lasted 1-2 s, affected areas typically 20-50 cm long by 10-20 cm wide, and involved bedload concentrations approximately 10 times greater than background, The distances travelled during displacements averaged about 15 times the particle diameter. Despite the differences in their dominant modes of movement, the 8- 16 mm particles typically travelled only about 30 YO slower during displacement than the 2–4 mm ones, whose speeds averaged 21 cm2 s-l. Particles starting from the same point not only moved intermittently downstream but also dispersed both longitudinally and transversely, with diffusivities of 4.6 and 0.26 cm2 s-l, respectively. The bedload transport rates measured from the films were consistent with those determined conventionally with a bedload sampler. The 2–4 mm particles were entrained 6 times faster on finer areas of the bed, where 8-16 mm particles covered 6 YO of the surface area, than on coarser ones, where they covered 12 {\%}, even though 2 4 and 4-8 mm particles covered practically the same percentage areas in both cases. The 4-8 and 8-16 mm particles, in contrast, were entrained a t the same rates in both cases. To within the statistical uncertainty, the rates of distrainment balanced the rates of entrainment for all three sizes, and were approximately proportional to the corresponding concentrations of bedload. {\textcopyright} 1988, Cambridge University Press.

abstract = {An experimental investigation into the fluctuating pressure acting on sediment particles on the bed of an open-channel flow was carried out in a large laboratory flume for a range of flow depths and bed slopes. The pressure measurements were made using 23 spherical particles instrumented with differential pressure sensors. These measurements were complemented with simultaneous measurements of the velocity field using high-resolution stereoscopic particle image velocimetry. The pressure statistics show that the standard deviations of the drag and lift fluctuations vary from 2.0 to 2.6 and from 2.5 to 3.4 times the wall shear stress, respectively, and are dependent on relative submergence and flow Reynolds number. The skewness is positive for the drag fluctuations and negative for the lift fluctuations. The kurtosis values of both drag and lift fluctuations increase with particle submergence. The two-particle correlation between drag and lift fluctuations is found to be relatively weak compared to the two-point drag-drag and lift-lift correlations. The pressure cross-correlations between particles separated in the longitudinal direction exhibit maxima at certain time delays corresponding to the convection velocities varying from 0.64 to 0.72 times the bulk flow velocity, being very close to the near-bed eddy convection velocities. The temporal autocorrelation of drag fluctuations decays much faster than that for the lift fluctuations; as a result, the temporal scales of lift fluctuations are 3-6 times that of drag fluctuations. The spatial and temporal scales of both drag and lift fluctuations show dependence on flow depth and bed slope. The spectral behaviour of both drag and lift fluctuations is also assessed. A f-11/3 slope is observed for the spectra of the drag fluctuations over the majority of the frequency range, whereas the lift spectra suggest two scaling ranges, following a f-11/3 slope at high frequencies and f-5/3 behaviour at lower frequencies.},

abstract = {The Bagnold hypothesis has been a major tool in the development of mechanistic models of bed load transport. According to the hypothesis, a necessary constraint for the maintenance of equilibrium bed load transport is that the fluid shear stress at the bed must be reduced to the critical, or threshold value associated with incipient motion of grains. The constraint determines a functional form for the areal concentration of bed load grains as a function of flow parameters. It is shown here, however, that the Bagnold hypothesis breaks down when applied to equilibrium bed load transport on beds with transverse slopes above a relatively modest value that is well below the angle of repose. In particular, under such conditions it is shown that no areal concentration, no matter how large, is sufficient to reduce the fluid shear stress at the bed to the critical value. This failure motivates the abandonment of the Bagnold constraint, even for nearly horizontal beds. The framework presented here, however, provides a natural basis for an entrainment-based model of sediment transport that neither satisfies nor suffers from the drawbacks of the Bagnold constraint.},

Specific elaboration techniques based on digital image processing were applied to films of the solid fluxes, allowing for automatic measurement. Sediment concentration was measured via a technique based on image subtraction and following proper filtering procedures, while grain velocity was measured by Particle Image Velocimetry. The method was applied in laboratory experiments of one dimensional bed load; the solid discharges measured by the proposed image processing technique were compared to those obtained by manual count of the grains passing over a fixed plate used as a sight. After calibration of the automatic technique, dimensionless solid discharges ranging from 1.0 × 10-3 to 1.2 × 10-1 were measured with a maximum error as large as 25{\%}. The technique proposed also enables measurement of the time variation of the quantities and the two dimensional direction of sediment motion, for a complete characterization of grain kinematics in solid transport processes. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2006.},

abstract = {Travel distance and residence time probability distributions are the key components of stochastic models for coarse sediment transport. Residence time for individual grains is difficult to measure, and residence time distributions appropriate to field and laboratory settings are typically inferred theoretically or from overall transport characteristics. However, bed elevation time series collected using sonar transducers and lidar can be translated into empirical residence time distributions at each elevation in the bed and for the entire bed thickness. Sediment residence time at a given depth can be conceptualized as a stochastic return time process on a finite interval. Overall sediment residence time is an average of residence times at all depths weighted by the likelihood of deposition at each depth. Theory and experiment show that when tracers are seeded on the bed surface, power law residence time will be observed until a timescale set by the bed thickness and bed fluctuation statistics. After this time, the long-time (global) residence time distribution will take exponential form. Crossover time is the time of transition from power law to exponential behavior. The crossover time in flume studies can be on the order of seconds to minutes, while that in rivers can be days to years.

abstract = {High-speed imaging of coarse sand particles transported as bed load reveals how particle motions possess intrinsic periodicities associated with their start-and-stop behavior. The dominant harmonics in these motions have a primary influence on the rate at which the mean squared particle displacement R($\tau$) - a measure conventionally used to assess the possibility of anomalous diffusion - increases with the time interval $\tau$. Over a timescale corresponding to the typical travel time of particles, calculations of R($\tau$) may ostensibly indicate non-Fickian behavior while actually reflecting the effects of periodicities in particle motions, not anomalous diffusion. We provide the theoretical basis for this observed behavior, and we illustrate how the effective (Fickian) particle diffusivity obtains from G. I. Taylor's classic definition involving the particle velocity autocovariance, including its relation to the ensemble-averaged particle velocity as articulated by O. M. Phillips. Cross-stream diffusivities are an order of magnitude smaller than streamwise diffusivities. {\textcopyright} 2012. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract = {Random walk models of fluvial bed load transport use probability distributions to describe the distance a grain travels during$\backslash$n an episode of transport and the time it rests after deposition. These models typically employ probability distributions with$\backslash$n finite first and second moments, reflecting an underlying assumption that all the factors that influence sediment transport$\backslash$n tend to combine in such a way that the length of a step or the duration of a rest can be characterized by a mean value surrounded$\backslash$n by a specific amount of variability. The observation that many transport systems exhibit apparent scale-dependent behavior$\backslash$n and non-Fickian dispersion suggests that this assumption is not always valid. We revisit a nearly 50 year old tracer experiment$\backslash$n in which the tracer plume exhibits the hallmarks of dispersive transport described by a step length distribution with a divergent$\backslash$n second moment and no characteristic dispersive size. The governing equation of this type of random walk contains fractional-order$\backslash$n derivatives. We use the data from the experiment to test two versions of a fractional-order model of dispersive fluvial bed$\backslash$n load transport. The first version uses a heavy-tailed particle step length distribution with a divergent second moment to$\backslash$n reproduce the anomalously high fraction of tracer mass observed in the downstream tail of the spatial distribution. The second$\backslash$n version adds a feature that partitions mass into a detectable mobile phase and an undetectable, immobile phase. This two-phase$\backslash$n transport model predicts other features observed in the data: a decrease in the amount of detected tracer mass over the course$\backslash$n of the experiment and enhanced particle retention near the source. The fractional-order models match the observed plume shape$\backslash$n and growth rates better than prior attempts with classical models.},

abstract = {Unsteady bedload transport was measured in two c. 5 m wide anabranches of a gravel-bed braided stream draining the Haut Glacier d'Arolla, Switzerland, during the 1998 and 1999 melt seasons. Bedload was directly sampled using 152 mm square Helley-Smith type samplers deployed from a portable measuring bridge, and independent transport rate estimates for the coarser size fractions were obtained from the dispersion of magnetically tagged tracer pebbles. Bedload transport time series show pulsing behaviour under both marginal (1998) and partial (1999) transport regimes. There are generally weak correlations between transport rates and shear stresses determined from velocity data recorded at the measuring bridge. Characteristic parameters of the bedload grain-size distributions (D50, D84) are weakly correlated with transport rates. Analysis of full bedload grain-size distributions reveals greater structure, with a tendency for transport to become less size selective at higher transport rates. The bedload time series show autoregressive behaviour but are difficult to distinguish by this method. State-space plots, and associated measures of time-series separation, reveal the structure of the time series more clearly. The measured pulses have distinctly different time-series characteristics from those modelled using a one-dimensional sediment routing model in which bed shear stress and grain size are varied randomly. These results suggest a mechanism of pulse generation based on irregular low-amplitude bedforms, that may be generated in-channel or may represent the advection of material supplied by bank erosion events. {\textcopyright} 2003 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper reviews sediment transport and channel morphology in small, forested streams in the Pacific Northwest region of North America to assess current knowledge of channel stability and morphology relevant to riparian management practices around small streams. Small channels are defined as ones in which morphology and hydraulics may be significantly influenced by individual clasts or wood materials in the channel. Such channels are headwater channels in close proximity to sediment sources, so they reflect a mix of hillslope and channel processes. Sediment inputs are derived directly from adjacent hillslopes and from the channel banks. Morphologically significant sediments move mainly as bed load, mainly at low intensity, and there is no standard method for measurement. The larger clastic and woody elements in the channel form persistent structures that trap significant volumes of sediment, reducing sediment transport in the short term and substantially increasing channel stability. The presence of such structures makes modeling of sediment flux in these channels - a potential substitute for measurement - difficult. Channel morphology is discussed, with some emphasis on wood related features. The problem of classifying small channels is reviewed, and it is recognized that useful classifications are purpose oriented. Reach scale and channel unit scale morphologies are categorized. A "disturbance cascade" is introduced to focus attention on sediment transfers through the slope channel system and to identify management practices that affect sediment dynamics and consequent channel morphology. Gaps in knowledge, errors, and uncertainties have been identified for future research. JAWRA Copyright {\textcopyright} 2005.},

abstract = {Bagnold developed his formula for bedload transport over several decades, with the final form of the relation given in his 1980 paper. In this formula, bedload transport rate is a function of stream power above some threshold value, depth and grain size. In 1986, he presented a graph which illustrated the strength of his relation. A double-log graph of bedload transport rate, adjusted for depth and grain size, versus excess stream power was shown to collapse along a line having a slope of 1.5. However, Bagnold based his analyses on limited data. In this paper, the formula is re-examined using a large data set in order to define the most consistent empirical representation, and dimensional analysis is performed to seek a rationalization of the formula. Functional analysis is performed for the final version of the equation defined by Bagnold to determine if the slope of 1.5 is preserved and to assess the strength of the relation. Finally, relations between excess stream power and bedload transport are examined for a fixed slope of 1.5 to assess the performance of various depth and grain size adjustment factors. The rational scaling is found to provide the best result. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {A Lagrangian model for the saltation of sand in water is proposed. Simulated saltation trajectories neglecting particle rotation and turbulence effects compare fairly well with experimental observations. The model for particle motion is coupled with a stochastic model for particle collision with the bed, such that a number of realizations of the saltation process can be simulated numerically. Model predictions of mean values and standard deviations of saltation height, length and streamwise particle velocity agree fairly well with experimental observations. Model predictions of the dynamic friction coefficient are also in good agreement with experimental observations, but they underestimate the value of 0.63 proposed by Bagnold for this coefficient. The saltation model is applied to the estimation of bedload transport rates of sand using a Bagnoldean formulation. Modelled values of the bedload transport rates overestimate those predicted by commonly used bedload formulae, which appears to be a consequence of problems in the definition of the dynamic friction coefficient. These results seem to indicate a few problems with the Bagnoldean formulation, particularly regarding the continuum assumption for the bedload layer, which would be valid only for very high particle concentrations and small particle diameters, and also regarding the evaluation of the shear stress exerted on the bed by the saltating particles.},

abstract = {This paper proposes that the changes which occur in composition of the bed load during the transport of mixed-grain-size sediments are largely controlled by the distributions of critical entrainment shear stress for the various size fractions. This hypothesis is examined for a unimodal sediment mixture by calculating these distributions with a discrete particle model and using them in a probabilistic calculation of bed-load composition. The estimates of bed-load composition compare favorably with observations of fractional transport rates made in a laboratory flume for the same sediment, suggesting that the hypothesis is reasonable. The analysis provides additional insight, in terms of grain mechanics, into the processes that determine bed-load composition. These insights strongly suggest that better prediction methods will result from taking account of the variation of threshold within size fractions, something that most previous studies have neglected.},

First a stochastic simulation of a turbulent velocity field is obtained by random Fourier modes. Then, this turbulent field is used as a source term in the Euler equations linearized around the mean flow previously calculated. This method was already applied to confined flows in 2-D and 3-D. Subsonic jet noise was also studied. However the SNGR model was applied with an axisymmetric calculation of the propagation.

Bed load transport rates fluctuate strongly in both nature and experiment, and stochastic models of the transport processes have been put forward to describe this behavior. In this paper I adapt a model based on a Markov chain formulation to derive probability distributions for bed load transport rate over a rock bed only partly covered by sediment. I propose a way to calculate the probability distribution of bed cover for given sediment supply using a combinatoric model and combine the two curves to calculate probability distributions for bed cover and erosion rate at constant hydraulics. In the proposed model, mean bed cover is an exponentially declining function of the number of particles in the control volume. The model describes recently published experimental data well, but at the moment it is not possible to finally discriminate between the exponential and the previously proposed linear model formulation. Distributions of erosion rate are fairly broad functions slightly skewed toward high erosion rates. {\textcopyright} 2009 by American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {The entrainment of sediments in rivers exhibits an intermittent behavior. Incipient motion should therefore be described as a random process requiring a stochastic predictive approach. The effect of near-bed turbulence on grain entrainment and the variation in bed particle stability due to local surface heterogeneity are included into a probabilistic framework. The intuitive evidence that hydrodynamic forces acting on the sediment bed and the resistance to motion of the bed particles are two mutually dependent aspects of a unique process is modeled by introducing a conditional independence hypothesis. Based on this concept, new insights into the stochastic aspects of incipient motion are obtained. For low ratios of the boundary shear stress to the critical shear stress, by including the mutual dependence of different processes the new theoretical development predicts up to 50{\%} larger probabilities of grain removal from the bed surface compared to Grass' original formulation. This follows from the entrainment risk being not only dependent on the distributions of fluid forces and grain resistance, but also on the correlation that these distributions exhibit in relation to the geometrical configuration of the sediment bed. This complex interaction is neglected in existing probabilistic models of sediment transport. It is then demonstrated that such additional contribution explains better the influence of both flow turbulence and particle arrangement on key features of the overall grain entrainment process. {\textcopyright} 2012.

abstract = {The interactions between turbulence events and sediment motions during bed load transport were studied by means of laser‐Doppler velocimetry and high‐speed cinematography. Sweeps (u′ {\textgreater} 0, w′ {\textless} 0) which contribute positively to the mean bed shear stress, collectively move the majority of the sediment, primarily because they are extremely common. Outward interactions (u′ {\textgreater} 0 w′ {\textgreater} 0) which contribute negatively to the bed shear stress and are relatively rare, individually move as much sediment as sweeps of comparable magnitude and duration, however, and much more than bursts (u′ {\textless} 0, w′ {\textgreater} 0) and inward interactions (u′ {\textless} 0, w′ {\textless} 0). When the magnitude of the outward interactions increases relative to the other events, therefore, the sediment flux increases even though the bed shear stress decreases. Thus, although bed shear stress can be used to estimate bed load transport by flows with well‐developed boundary layers, in which the flow is steady and uniform and the turbulence statistics all scale with the shear velocity, it is not accurate for flows with developing boundary layers, such as those over sufficiently nonuniform topography or roughness, in which significant spatial variations in the magnitudes and durations of the sweeps, bursts, outward interactions, and inward interactions occur. These variations produce significant peaks in bed load transport downstream of separation points, thus supporting the hypothesis that flow separation plays a significant role in the development of bed forms.

We subject a bed of settling plastic particles to a laminar-shear flow from above, and use refractive-index-matching to track particles' motion and determine local rheology - from the fluid-granular interface to deep in the granular bed. Data from all experiments collapse onto a single curve of friction $\mu$ as a function of the viscous number Iv over the range 3×10-5≤Iv≤2, validating the local rheology model. For Iv{\textless}3×10-5, however, data do not collapse. Instead of undergoing a jamming transition with $\mu$→$\mu$s as expected, particles transition to a creeping regime where we observe a continuous decay of the friction coefficient $\mu$≤$\mu$s as Iv decreases. The rheology of this creep regime cannot be described by the local model, and more work is needed to determine whether a nonlocal rheology model can be modified to account for our findings.},

abstract = {Bed load transport is a highly complex process. The probability density function (PDF) of particle velocities results from the local particle momentum variability in response to fluid drag and interactions with the bed. Starting from the forces exerted on a single particle under low transport rates (i.e., rolling and sliding regimes), we derive here the nonlinear stochastic Langevin equation (LE) to describe the dynamics of a single particle, accounting for both the deterministic and the stochastic components of such forces. Then, the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE), which describes the evolution of the PDF of the ensemble particle velocities, is derived from the LE. We show that the theoretical PDFs of both streamwise and cross-stream velocities obtained by solving the FPE under equilibrium conditions have exponential form (PDFs of both positive and negative velocities decay exponentially), consistent with the experimental data by Roseberry et al. (). Moreover, we theoretically show how the exponential-like PDF of an ensemble of particle velocities results from the forces exerted on a single particle. We also show that the simulated particle motions using the proposed Langevin model exhibit an emergent nonlinear relationship between hop distances and travel times (power law with exponent 5/3), in agreement with the experimental data, providing a statistical description of the particles' random motion in the context of a stochastic transport process. Finally, our study emphasizes that the motion of individual particles, described by the LE, and the behavior of the ensemble, described by the FPE, are connected within a statistical mechanics framework. {\textcopyright}2014.

abstract = {Experimental and computational evidence shows that bed state adjustments can accommodate a twofold to fourfold change in sediment supply without otherwise affecting the morphology of a sinuous gravel bed stream channel with nonerodible banks. In contrast, previously published experiments of the same kind but with erodible channel banks suggest that changes in sediment supply are taken up almost exclusively by changes in channel sinuosity and hence the reach-average water surface gradient. It appears that stream channel response to changes in sediment supply is strongly conditioned by the nature of the stream boundary, and that determines which of several potential adjustments are possible.

The frequency dependence of $\sigma$($\omega$) is determined by the Fourier transform of the zeroth and second spatial moments of the function $\psi$(s→,t), which is equal to the probability per unit time that the displacement and time between hops is s→, t.

abstract = {Accounting for the burial of tracer particles during bedload transport is an important component in the formulation of tracer dispersal in rivers. Herein we propose a modified active layer formulation, which accounts for the effect of burial and admits analytical solutions, enabling insightful exploration of the phenomenon of superdiffusion of bedload tracers at the intermediate timescale. This phenomenon has been observed in recent numerical results using the 2-D Exner-Based Master Equation. By assuming that tracers in the active layer can exchange with nontracer particles in the substrate layer to preserve mass, and that tracers entering the substrate layer get permanently trapped during the timescale of analysis, we are able to deduce governing equations for the tracer concentration in both layers. The active layer tracer concentration is shown to be governed by an advection-diffusion equation with a sink term, and the increase of tracers in the substrate layer is driven by a corresponding source term. The solution for the variance of tracer population is analytically determined and can be approximated by the sum of a diffusion-induced scaling (∝t 1 ) and an advection-induced scaling (∝t 3 ) terms at the intermediate timescale, which explains the phenomenon of superdiffusion. The proposed formulation is shown to be able to capture the key characteristics of tracer transport as inferred by comparison with available results of numerical simulations.},

@article{Pitlick2013,
abstract = {We conducted a series of flume experiments to investigate the response of self-formed gravel-bed channels to floods of varying magnitude and duration. Floods were generated by increasing the discharge into a channel created in sand- and gravel-sized sediment with a median grain size of 2 mm. Flooding increased the Shields stress along the channel perimeter, causing bank erosion and rapid channel widening. The sediment introduced to the channel by bank erosion was not necessarily deposited on the channel bed, but was rather transported downstream, a process likely facilitated by transient fining of the bed surface. At the end of each experiment, bank sediments were no longer in motion, "partial bed load transport" characterized the flat-bed portion of the channel, and the Shields stress approached a constant value of 0.056, about 1.2 times the critical Shields stress for incipient motion. Furthermore, the discharge was entirely accommodated by flow within the channel: the creation of a stable channel entirely eliminated overbank flows. We speculate that similar processes may occur in nature, but only where bank sediments are non-cohesive and where channel-narrowing processes cannot counteract bank erosion during overbank flows. We also demonstrate that a simple model of lateral bed load transport can reproduce observed channel widening rates, suggesting that simple methods may be appropriate for predicting width increases in channels with non-cohesive, unvegetated banks, even during overbank flows. Last, we present a model for predicting the equilibrium width and depth of a stable gravel-bed channel with a known channel-forming Shields stress. Key Points Channels in sand/gravel sediment equilibrate to floods by increases in width Morphologic equilibrium occurs at transport stages of about 1.2 Results imply that natural channels will widen until floods are eliminated {\textcopyright}2013.

abstract = {While the stabilizing function of large grains in step-pool streams has long been recognized, the role they play in gravel-bed streams is less clear. Most researchers have ignored the role of large grains in gravel-bed streams, and have assumed that the median bed surface size controls the erodibility of alluvial boundaries. The experiments presented herein challenge this convention. Two experiments were conducted that demonstrate the significant morphodynamic implications of a slight change to the coarse tail of the bed material. The two distributions had the same range of particle sizes, and nearly identical bulk d50 values (1.6 mm); however the d90 of experiment GSD1 was slightly finer (3.7 mm) than that for experiment GSD2 (3.9 mm). Transport rates during GSD1 were nearly four times greater than during GSD2 (even though the dimensionless shear stress was slightly lower), and the channel developed a sinuous pattern with well-developed riffles, pools and bars. During GSD2 the initial rectangular channel remained virtually unchanged for the duration of the experiment. The relative stability of GSD2 seems to be associated with a slightly larger proportion of stable (large) grains on the bed surface: at the beginning of GSD1, 3.5{\%} of the bed was immobile, while almost twice as much of it (6.1{\%}) was immobile at the beginning of GSD2. The results demonstrate that the largest grains (not the median size) exert first-order control on channel stability. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2017 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

The analyses included vertical distributions of local mean velocities, turbulence intensities, turbulent shear stresses, velocity auto- and cross-spectra, the quadrant method, and high-order velocity moments. A number of properties of turbulence intensities, high-order moments, streamwise bursting parameters, and velocity spectra appeared to be similar for all three flows, but some properties were different. The most important one was an observed reduction in the von Ka ´rma ´n constant for the flow with weakly mobile bed. Comparison of these results with other studies and analogies with drag-reducing flows suggest that at ?o /?oc ? 1 the drag on the bed for a given granular material should be minimized.},

abstract = {Sediment particles transported as bed load undergo alternating periods of motion and rest, particularly at weak flow intensity. Bed load transport can be investigated by either following the motion of individual particles (Lagrangian approach) or observing the phenomenon at prescribed locations (Eulerian approach). In this paper, the Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptions are merged into a unifying framework that includes definitions for quantities used to describe the kinematics of particle motion, as well as the relationships among these quantities. The alternation of motion and rest is represented by two complementary descriptions: (i) proportion of motion, indicating either the relative time spent in motion by an individual particle or the relative number of moving particles; (ii) persistence of motion, indicating the extent to which the process consists of relatively few long periods of motion or of many short ones. The framework only involves first moments of the key quantities. The conceptual developments are tested against results from an experiment with weak bed load transport, demonstrating the soundness of the approach. From an operational point of view, a Lagrangian observation is difficult to perform, since the particle motion is usually investigated for finite spatial domains (e.g., a measurement window within a laboratory or natural reach). Strategies to overcome such limitations are described, suggesting the possibility of obtaining unbiased mean values for Lagrangian descriptors. The proposed framework can be used in any study aimed at parameterizing the kinematic properties of bed load particles as functions of the hydrodynamic conditions.},

The spectra taken for the velocity field are of the form E(k) ∝ $\delta$(k - k0) and E(k) ∝ k4 exp (-2k 2/k02) in three dimensions, and E(k) ∝ $\delta$(k - k0) and E(k) ∝ k3 exp (-3k 2/2k02) in two dimensions. Both frozen Eulerian fields and fields with Gaussian time correlation are treated. The simulation results agree with Taylor's picture of a classical diffusion process for times long compared with the eddy circulation time, except for the frozen-Eulerian-field runs in two dimensions, where strong trapping effects are found. The direct-interaction approximations for Lagrangian velocity correlation, eddy diffusivity, dispersion, and modal response functions agree well with the computer experiments except where there are trapping effects, which the approximation completely fails to represent.},

abstract = {The sculpture of valleys by flowing water is widely recognized, and simplified models of incision by this process (e.g., the stream power law) are the basis for most recent landscape evolution models. Under steady state conditions a stream power law predicts that channel slope varies as an inverse power law of drainage area. Using both contour maps and laser altimetry, we find that this inverse power law rarely extends to slopes greater than ∼0. 03 to 0.10, values below which debris flows rarely travel. Instead, with decreasing drainage area the rate of increase in slope declines, leading to a curved relationship on a log-log plot of slope against drainage area. Fieldwork in the western United States and Taiwan indicates that debris flow incision of bedrock valley floors tends to terminate upstream of where strath terraces begin and where area-slope data follow fluvial power laws. These observations lead us to propose that the steeper portions of unglaciated valley networks of landscapes steep enough to produce mass failures are predominately cut by debris flows, whose topographic signature is an area-slope plot that curves in log-log space. This matters greatly as valleys with curved area-slope plots are both extensive by length ({\textgreater}80{\%} of large steepland basins) and comprise large fractions of main stem valley relief (25-100{\%}). As a consequence, valleys carved by debris flows, not rivers, bound most hillslopes in unglaciated steeplands. Debris flow scour of these valleys appears to limit the height of some mountains to substantially lower elevations than river incision laws would predict, an effect absent in current landscape evolution models. We anticipate that an understanding of debris flow incision, for which we currently lack even an empirical expression, would substantially change model results and inferences drawn about linkages between landscape morphology and tectonics, climate, and geology.},

@article{Wolman1959,
abstract = {ABSTRACT The relative importance in geomorphic processes of extreme or catastrophic events and more frequent events of smaller magnitude can be measured in terms of (1) the relative amounts of "work" done on the landscape and (2) in terms of the formation of specific features of the landscape. For many processes, above the level of competence, the rate of movement of material can be expressed as a power function of some stress, as for example, shear stress. Because the frequency distributions of the magnitudes of many natural events, such as floods, rainfall, and wind speeds, approximate log-normal dis-tributions, the product of frequency and rate, a measure of the work performed by events having different frequencies and magnitudes will attain a maximum. The frequency at which this maximum occurs provides a measure of the level at which the largest portion of the total work is accomplished. Analysis of records of sediment transported by rivers indicates that the largest portion of the total load is carried by flows which occur on the average once or twice each year. As the variability of the flow increases and hence as the size of the drainage basin decreases, a larger percentage of the total load is carried by less frequent flows. In many basins 90 per cent of the sediment is removed by storm discharges which recur at least once every five years. Transport of sand and dust by wind in general follows the same laws. The extreme velocities associated with infrequent events are compensated for by their rarity, and it is found that the greatest bulk of sediment is transported by more moderate events. Many rivers are competent to erode both bed and banks during moderate flows. Observations of natural channels suggest that the channel shape as well as the dimensions of meandering rivers appear to be associ-ated with flows at or near the bankfull stage. The fact that the bankfull stage recurs on the average once every year or two years indicates that these features of many alluvial rivers are controlled by these more frequent flows rather than by the rarer events of catastrophic magnitude. Because the equilibrium form of wind-blown dunes and of wave-formed beaches is quite unstable, the frequency of the events responsible for their form is less clearly definable. However, dune form and orientation are determined by both wind velocity and frequency. Similarly, a hypothetical example suggests that beach slope oscillates about a mean value related in part to wave characteristics generated by winds of moderate speed. Where stresses generated by frequent events are incompetent to transport available materials, less fre-quent ones of greater magnitude are obviously required. Closer observation of many geomorphic processes is required before the relative importance of different processes and of events of differing magnitude and frequency in the formation of given features of the landscape can be adequately evaluated.},

abstract = {Ecologically effective ecosystem management will require the development of a robust logic, rationale, and framework for addressing the inherent limitations of scientific understanding. It must incorporate a strategy for avoiding irreversible or large-scale environmental mistakes that arise from social and political forces that tend to promote fragmented, uncritical, short-sighted, inflexible, and overly optimistic assessments of resource status, management capabilities, and the consequences of decisions and policies. Aquatic resources are vulnerable to the effects of human activities catchment-wide, and many of the landscape changes humans routinely induce cause irreversible damage (e.g., some species introductions, extinctions of ecotypes and species) or give rise to cumulative, long-term, large-scale biological and cultural consequences (e.g., accelerated erosion and sedimentation, deforestation, toxic contamination of sediments). In aquatic ecosystems, biotic impoverishment and environmental disruption caused by past management and natural events profoundly constrain the ability of future management to maintain biodiversity and restore historical ecosystem functions and values. To provide for rational, adaptive progress in ecosystem management and to reduce the risk of irreversible and unanticipated consequences, managers and scientists must identify catchments and aquatic networks where ecological integrity has been least damaged by prior management, and jointly develop means to ensure their protection as reservoirs of natural biodiversity, keystones for regional restoration, management models, monitoring benchmarks, and resources for ecological research.},

The results of coupling the dispersed phase to a multiphase flow solver that uses volume-averaged Navier-Stokes equations are compared to those obtained from coupling through drag to a single flow solver. The current work also examines the applicability and limitations of lumping particles as a representative particle to reduce the cost of simulations. Insight to the impact of different turbulent events to the entrainment of particles is also given. The simulation results of sediment transport from both coupling techniques show good agreement with empirical formulas in the bedload regime, but under-predict sediment transport in the suspended load regime. In the suspended load regime, using partial coupling, the rate of sediment transport was found to be under-predicted as compared to full-coupling. The deviation in results in the suspended load regime was found to increase with increases in the applied shear stress. Both coupling methods revealed the same effect on the friction factor where friction increases in the bedload regime and decreases in the suspended load regime reaching a maximum at the transition between regimes. This result is contrary to past studies which have shown a discrete jump in the friction factor at the transition. Lumping particles as representative particles is shown to reduce the simulation cost by more than a factor of 5 when using a scaling factor of 2. By doing a quadrant analysis on information obtained from particle and flow field results, it was found that most of the particles are entrained by more frequent sweep events.},

It is intended primarily for graduate students and researchers in hydraulic engineering, geomorphology, physical geography and other disciplines dealing with the behaviour and evolution of rivers. The first chapter deals with fundamentals (dimensional methods, two-phase motion, mechanical flow properties, sediment transport, etc). Chapter 2 deals exclusively with the interpretation of turbulence in the light of recent advances. Chapter 3 concerns bed forms. Chapter 4 covers regime trends from the point of view that an alluvial stream evolves when one of its energy-related properties tends to its extreme value. The regime trend is used to determine the width, depth and slope of an alluvial stream and explain its behaviour in plan. Chapter 5 covers braiding and meandering, and shows that the extent of these depends largely on how the initial or valley slope of a stream compares with its regime slope. (from Author)},

abstract = {A new approach to noise modeling for free turbulent flows is presented. The equations governing the sound field are obtained in two steps. The first step consists of treating the mean and turbulent components of the flow while the acoustic perturbations are neglected. In the second step, a set of equations is derived for the acoustic variables. On the left-hand side of this system, one finds the linearized Euler equations, whereas the right-hand side exhibits source terms related to the turbulent fluctuations and their interactions with the mean flow. These terms are modeled using a stochastic description of the three-dimensional turbulent motion. This is achieved by synthesizing the velocity field at each point in space and for all times with a collection of discrete Fourier modes. The synthesized field posesses the suitable one- and two-point statistical moments and a reasonable temporal power spectral density. The linearized Euler equations including a stochastic description of noise sources are solved numerically with a scheme based on a fractional step treatment. Each one-dimensional problem is solved with a weak formulation. A set of calculations are carried out for a simple freejet. Comparisons between calculations and experiments indicate that a spatial filtering of the source terms is required to obtain the expected level in the far field. Realistic pressure signals, power spectral densities, and sound field patterns are obtained. It is indicated that the stochastic noise generation and radiation (SNGR) approach may be applied to more complex flows because the numerical codes used to calculate the mean flowfield and the wave propagation are not specific of jet configurations. The limitations of the present model lie in the statistical properties of the synthetic turbulent field and in the use of an axisymmetric modeling of the acoustic propagation. {\textcopyright} 1994 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc., All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Results are presented of a series of experiments in which were measured: The mean critical bed shear stress at Shields' grain-movement condition and at the initiation of non-ceasing scour, the rate of bedload transport, the average particle velocity, the rate of deposition, and the average length of individual steps of saltating bed-load particles, in water, as a function of the time-mean bed shear stress. These experiments were performed in a closed rectangular flow channel at different slopes of the bed surface and using five different bed materials (two sands, gravel, magnetite and walnut grains). Comparing the threshold drag acting at different downward slopes of the bed surface (0°, 12°, 18° and 22°) a surprisingly large critical-drag angle of 47° was found. The initiation of non-ceasing scour of a loose granular bed was studied experimentally behind a consolidated bed of the same material as the loose bed. The corresponding instantaneous threshold drag was about three times larger than the threshold drag acting at Shields' grain movement condition. The rate of bed-load transport measured as a function of the mean bed-shear stress satisfies a generalised Meyer-Peter and Muller formula (1948), also at various downward slopes of the bed surface, as investigated up to 22°. The rate of particle deposition was found to be proportional to the rate of bed-load transport, and the average length of individual particle steps was found to be a constant. This implies that the probability of a bed-load particle being deposited when striking the bed surface is independent of the flow rate within the experimental range. This result contradicts Einstein's theory of bed-load transport (1950). Close examination of the motion of saltating bed-load particles revealed that these particles are transported almost in suspension for the greater part of their trajectory. The average transport velocity of the suspended particles was found to be equal to the average fluid velocity calculated for a turbulent flow without a bed load, at about three particle diameters above the bed surface, minus a constant. The constant was proportional to the critical shear velocity at Shields' grain-movement condition. This can be explained by considering that the turbulent shear flow must exert a lift force on the suspended particles that is practically equal to their submerged weight. Combining the Meyer-Peter and Muller formula for the rate of bed-load transport and the above-mentioned expression for the average transport velocity of the bed-load particles shows that the areal bed-load concentration increases linearly with increasing bed-shear stress. This contradicts Kalinske's theory (1947). Calculation of the average reduction in fluid shear at the bed surface due to the bed load, using empirical relations for the transfer of momentum of bed-load particles to the bed surface by intergranular collisions and for the areal bed-load concentration, reveals that at low transport rates this reduction is very small. The critical shear stress required to erode the topmost grains of the bed surface must therefore increase with increasing bed shear stress. It was also found that the average reduction in fluid shear due to the bed load increases so rapidly with increasing bed-shear stress that a higher transport rates the remaining fluid shear will nowhere exceed the threshold drag corresponding to the initiation of “non-ceasing” scour. {\textcopyright} 1976 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

The fluid is modeled as a moving layer or “slab” which exerts a velocity‐dependent drag force on embedded particles and satisfies its own momentum balance equation. Bed load mass flux and hop length and hop height statistics of simulated beds resemble those observed in the laboratory. By marking particles originally residing on the surface, vertical mixing of sediment is investigated. An injection of fine particles into a bed load system of coarse particles under traction illustrates the early stages of the evolution of sedimentary stratigraphy. Friction angles and their distribution are investigated as a function of bed transport history and particle size. The main thrust of the paper, however, is to describe and test a microscopic bed load model which engineers, geologists, and biologists may find useful for applications where particle arrangement and relative particle motion are important.

abstract = {Pebble clusters are common small-scale morphological features in gravel-bed rivers, occupying as much as 10 per cent of the bed surface. Important links exist between the presence of pebble clusters and the development of flow structures. These links are poorly understood at the three-dimensional level. Particularly neglected has been the effect of clusters on the lateral flow characteristics. A laboratory study was conducted using a hydraulic flume, within which simulated pebble clusters were superimposed onto a plane bed of gravel material. High-resolution three-dimensional flow data were collected above the bed at two different flow depths using an acoustic Doppler velocimeter. The results present evidence of the importance of lateral flow in the development of turbulent flow structure. Narrow regions of high lateral and downstream turbulence intensity exist to both sides of clusters and in a three-dimensional separation zone in their lee. This may indicate the presence of horseshoe-type vortical structures analogous to those identified in less hydraulically rough environments. However, it is likely that these structures are more complicated given the mutual interference of the surrounding medium. The lateral flow was also identified as a key component in the upwelling identified by other authors in the lee of pebble clusters. The results of the vertical flow analysis confirm the hypothesis that six regions with distinct vertical flow characteristics exist above clusters: Flow acceleration up the stoss-side of the cluster; recirculation behind the cluster in the wake region; vortex shedding from the pebble crest and shear layer; flow reattachment downstream of the cluster; upwelling of flow downstream of the point of reattachment; and recovery of flow.

The theoretical starting point is usually a set of deterministic equations of motion, typically in the form of nonlinear partial differential equations. These are sometimes supplemented by stochastic terms representing thermal or instrumental noise, but for macroscopic systems and carefully designed experiments the stochastic forces are often negligible. An aim of theory is to describe solutions of the deterministic equations that are likely to be reached starting from typical initial conditions and to persist at long times. A unified description is developed, based on the linear instabilities of a homogeneous state, which leads naturally to a classification of patterns in terms of the characteristic wave vector q0 and frequency 0 of the instability.},

The simulation produces an extremely variable bed topography in which at least two scales of bedform may be identified. Features of 5–10 grain wavelengths, similar to pebble clusters, are superimposed on other forms whose wavelength is up to 30–40 grains and which resemble step‐pools systems and antidunes.

Morphological characterization of clusters is presented in terms of: (i) cluster shape; (ii) cluster geometric properties; and (iii) the spatial arrangement of clusters in the horizontal plane. Clusters were differentiated from other microtopography features such as reticulate structures and transverse ribs, and identified clusters were categorized by shape as being of pebble, line, comet, heap or ring type. The complex spatial arrangement of clusters at the sites was characterized by using a two-dimensional correlation function, which allowed for measurement of the average cluster-spacing properties. For the rivers examined, pebble-shaped clusters were the most frequently observed cluster shape. Cluster geometric properties were found to be controlled by particles of the largest size fraction in the bed and the projected frontal width of the cluster - with cluster length being linearly related to cluster width for cluster width-to-height ratios {\textless}3{\textperiodcentered}5. Results of the cluster-spacing analysis suggest that cluster spacing increases with cluster size and decreases with local slope. Application of this principle to the available spacing data shows that cluster spacing $\lambda$ scales with the ratio of S/d0 such that $\lambda$S/ d0 = constant, where S is the local slope and d0 the diameter of the largest particle in the cluster. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors.

abstract = {Structured gravel river beds clearly exert a major influence on bed stability. Indexing structural stability by field measurements of bed strength neglects the processes operating to entrain and transport bed material in different parts of each structure. This study takes a morphological approach to interpreting the critical processes, using particle tracing to determine the movement of individual cluster particles over a range of flood event magnitudes and durations. The experiment was carried out on the River South Tyne, UK; it uses flow hydrographs measured nearby and also benefits from previous studies of historical development, channel morphology and sediment transport at the same site. More than 30 clusters were monitored over a seven-month period during which clusters occupied 7-16 per cent of the bed. Threshold flows delimiting three apparently contrasting bed sediment process regimes for cluster particles are tentatively set at 100 m3 s-1 and 183 m3 s-1; durations of flow at these levels are critical for cluster development, rather than flow peak values. Wake particles are transported most easily. Flow straightening in the wandering channel planform reduces the stability of clusters, since mechanical strength is markedly reduced by this change of direction. The overall area covered by clusters between significant transport events varies little, implying a dynamic equilibrium condition. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2005 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Steep mountain streams typically feature macro-roughness elements like boulders, step-pool sequences, and a varying channel width. Flow resistance because of such roughness elements appears to be an important control on bedload transport rates. Many commonly used bedload transport equations overestimate the transport in steep streams by orders of magnitude. Few approaches take into account the typical macro-roughness elements, and systematic tests of these models with field observations are lacking. In the present study several approaches were considered that allow calculating the contribution of macro-roughness elements to flow resistance. These approaches were combined with bedload transport equations and the predictions were compared to field measurements of discharge, transported bedload volumes, and channel characteristics in 13 Swiss mountain streams. The streams have channel slopes ranging from 2{\%} to 19{\%}, and catchment areas of 0.5 to 170 km 2. For six streams there were time series of sediment yields, mostly measured annually, and for the other seven streams sediment volume estimates were available for large flood events in 2000 and 2005. All tested equation combinations achieved an improvement in bedload prediction compared to a reference equation that was uncorrected for macro-roughness. The prediction accuracy mainly depended on the size and density of the macro-roughness and on flow conditions. The best performance overall was achieved by an empirical approach accounting for macro-roughness, on the basis of an independent data set of flow resistance measurements.

abstract = {Steep, rough channels occupy a large fraction of the total channel length in mountainous regions. Most sediment mobilized on hillslopes must pass through these streams before reaching lower-gradient channels. Steep channels have wide grain size distributions that are composed of finer, more mobile sediment and large, rarely mobile grains. The large grains can bear a significant portion of the total shear stress and thereby reduce the stress available to move the finer sediment. Conventional bed load transport equations often overpredict the sediment flux in steep channels by several orders of magnitude. We hypothesize that sediment transport equations overpredict the sediment flux because they do not (1) account for the stress borne by rarely mobile grains, (2) differentiate between highly and rarely mobile sediment, and (3) account for the limited availability of mobile sediment. Here we modify a conventional bed load transport equation to include these three effects. We use measurements of the flow, bed properties, and sediment flux in a small, steep flume to test this equation. We supply gravel at a constant rate through fields of regularly spaced immobile spheres and measure the bed coverage by gravel and sphere protrusion (the percent of the sphere that protrudes above the gravel deposit). For a given sphere spacing, the proportion of the bed covered by gravel increases and the sphere protrusion decreases with greater sediment supply. Thus bed coverage and immobile grain protrusion may serve as proxies for sediment availability in steep, rough streams. Unlike most transport equations that we tested, our modified bed load equation predicts sediment fluxes to within an order of magnitude of the measured values. Our results demonstrate that accurately predicting bed load transport in steep, rough streams may require accounting for the effects of local sediment availability (coverage by mobile sediment) and drag due to rarely mobile particles.

abstract = {Knowledge of hydraulic resistance of single-valued self-affine fractal surfaces remains very limited. To advance this area, a set of experiments have been conducted in two separate open-channel flumes to investigate the effects of the spectral structure of bed roughness on the drag at the bed. Three self-affine fractal roughness patterns, based on a simple but realistic three-range spectral model, have been investigated with spectral scaling exponents of −1, −5/3 and −3, respectively. The different widths of the flumes and a range of flow depths also afforded an opportunity to consider effects of the flow aspect ratio and relative submergence. The results show that with all else equal the friction factor increases as the spectral exponent decreases. In addition, the relationship between the spectral exponent and effective slope of the roughness is demonstrated, for the first time. Aspect ratio effects on the friction factor within the studied range were found to be negligible.},

abstract = {A model for the velocity field over a poorly sorted bed is derived herein and applied to flow in steep streams with coarse gravel beds. In such streams, large clasts often are comparable in size to stream depth and act as obstacles to the flow. The effect of these obstacles on a flow is estimated by partitioning total stress, proportional to the depth‐slope product, into a purely fluid component and a form‐drag component associated with flow around the obstacles. An eddy viscosity closure is used, with a length scale dependent on both distance from the boundary and wake dimension. Resulting velocity profiles agree well with profiles measured by Marchand et al. (1984) in nine mountain streams in Colorado. Model runs for a range of conditions reveal that the velocity distribution depends primarily on D84z and flow depth h; D84z is the length of the vertically oriented axis of clasts at the 84th percentile of the grain size distribution. Calculated values of mean velocity, normalized by shear velocity, are well represented by a simple log linear relationship in terms of relative roughness D84/h.

abstract = {In fluvial geomorphology, one of the most pervasive paradigms is that the size of the grains present in a river exercises an important effect on its character. In gravel-bed rivers, there is considerable scatter in the relations between so-called “representative grain sizes” and basic channel processes and morphologies. Under a grain size paradigm, our ability to rationalize the characteristics of a given channel and predict how it will respond to a change in conditions is limited. In this paper, I deconstruct this paradigm by exploring its historical origins in geomorphology and fluid dynamics, and identify three of its underlying premises: (1) the association between grain diameter and fluid drag derived from Nikuradse's experiments with sand-coated surfaces; (2) the use of grain size by early process geomorphologists to describe general trends across large samples of sand-bed rivers; and (3) a classificatory approach to discerning bed structures originally developed for bed configurations found in sand-bed rivers. The conflation of sand- and gravel-bed rivers limits our ability to understand gravel-bed morphodynamics. Longstanding critique of the grain size paradigm has generated alternative ideas but, due to technological and conceptual limitations, they have remained unrealized. One such unrealized idea is the morphology-based definition of bed state – an important degree of freedom within fluvial systems, particularly in reaches where adjustments to planform are not easily achieved. By embracing recent advancements in fluid dynamics and remote sensing, I present an alternative or complementary concept of bed state based on the notion that fluvial systems act to maximize flow resistance. The proposed quantitative index represents the relative contribution of morphologic adjustments occurring at different spatial scales (discriminated using a wavelet transform) to a stable channel configuration. By explicitly acknowledging the complexity of bed adjustments we can move toward a more complete understanding of channel stability in gravel-bed rivers.},

abstract = {We present evidence that a final epoch of widespread fluvial erosion and deposition in the cratered highlands during the latest Noachian or early to mid-Hesperian was characterized by integration of flow within drainage networks as long as 4000 km and trunk valley incision of 50 to 350 m into earlier Noachian depositional basins. Locally deltaic sediments were deposited where incised valley systems debouched into basins. Large alluvial fans of sediment deposited from erosion of alcoves in steep crater walls probably formed contemporaneously. The depth of incision below Noachian surfaces correlates strongly with the gradient and the total valley length, suggesting consistent regional hydrology. Estimated discharges from channel dimensions indicate flow rates equivalent to mean annual floods in terrestrial drainage basins of equivalent size. Such high flow rates imply either runoff directly from precipitation or rapid melting of accumulated snow. Development of duricrusts on the Noachian landscape may have contributed to focusing of late-stage erosion within major trunk drainages. This late-stage epoch of intense fluvial activity appears to be fundamentally different than the fluvial environment prevailing during most of the Noachian Period, which was characterized by widespread fluvial erosion of highlands and crater rims, deeply infilling crater floors, and intercrater basins through ephemeral fluvial activity, and development of local rather than regionally integrated drainage networks.

Step wavelength and hydraulic requirements are consistent with those of the antidune process of formation, but results also suggest that true antidunes may be difficult to achieve in the steep headwaters where channels may be dominated by large roughness elements.

abstract = {We use flume experiments to better understand how gravel-bed channels maintain bed surface stability in response to pulses of sediment supply. Bed elevations and surface imagery at high spatial resolutions were used to quantify the co-evolution of surface grain-size distribution (GSD), bed roughness statistics, and bed surface structures (clusters, cells and transverse features). Using a new semi-automated method, we identified individual stone structures over a 2 m × 1 m area throughout the experiments. After an initial coarsening, surface GSD and armouring ratio remained nearly stable as sediment pulses caused net bed aggradation. In contrast, individual grain structures continued to form, increase or decrease in size, and disappear throughout the experiments. The response of the bed to sediment pulses depended on the history of surface roughness evolution and bed surface structure development, as these factors changed much more in response to supply perturbations earlier in the experiments compared to later, even as the bed continued to aggrade. We interpret that the dynamic production and destruction of bed surface structures can act as a ‘buffer' to sediment supply pulses, maintaining a stable bed surface during aggradation with minimal change in grain size or armouring. {\textcopyright} 2019 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {How does a mountain river adjust to accommodate repeated flood hydrographs? Do flood hydrographs cause major cycles of aggradation and degradation of the river bed? Here flume experiments are used to explore this problem. The response of a gravel bed river to repeated floods is modeled in the simplest possible way. The gravel is well sorted, the flume is operated in sediment feed mode, and the gravel feed rate is held constant. The flow discharge, on the other hand, is specified in terms of the repetition of the same hydrograph until mobile bed equilibrium (averaged over the hydrograph) is achieved. The results of the experiments demonstrate a remarkable trade-off. In a short inlet "boundary layer" (transition region) the bed elevation and bed slope fluctuate cyclically with the changing flow discharge, while the gravel transport rate remains nearly equal to the constant feed rate. Downstream of this short reach, however, the bed elevation and bed slope do not fluctuate in response to the hydrograph; all the fluctuation is transferred to the gravel transport rate. These results are verified in terms of one-dimensional analytical and numerical modeling. This modeling shows that the trade-off is inevitable as long as the morphologic response time of the reach in question is sufficiently long compared to the duration of a single hydrograph. The implication is that gravel bed rivers tend to adjust to hydrographs so as to minimize the response of the bed and maximize the response of the bed load transport rate to fluctuating flow discharge.

abstract = {Stream channel morphology forms the template upon which hydraulic aspects of aquatic habitat are created, yet spatial and temporal variability in habitat imposed by changing morphology is not well understood. This paper presents a conceptual model linking sediment supply patterns to spatial and temporal variability in channel form and aquatic habitat. To evaluate this model, change over time in three habitat variables is quantified using a 2D hydrodynamic modeling approach. A 45-year record of topographic data from Carnation Creek, a catchment in coastal British Columbia, is used for the flow modeling. Using the Nays2DH modeling platform, water depths and velocities are simulated in eight channel segments located at different positions relative to locations of historical colluvial input using seven flow levels ranging from 3{\%} to 400{\%} of mean annual discharge (0.02 to 3.31 m 3 s-1). Results indicate that habitat availability changes through time as a result of sediment supply-driven changes to channel morphology and wood loads, but patterns in habitat vary as a function of dominant channel segment morphology. Spatial and temporal variability in morphology also influences the relationship between habitat availability and river discharge, leading to non-stationary habitat-discharge rating curves. When habitat areas are predicted by applying these curves to daily flow series spanning annual dry seasons, over 50{\%} of the variance in cumulative seasonal habitat area can be explained by year-to-year changes in channel morphology and wood loading, indicating that changing morphology is an important factor for driving temporal habitat variability. This variance is related to the morphological variability of a channel segment, which in turn is associated with the segment position relative to zones of colluvial input. Collectively, these results suggest that variability in habitat is impacted by channel morphology, and can be evaluated partly on the basis of a channel's sediment supply regime. {\textcopyright} 2019 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Measuring bedload transport rates usually involves measuring the flux of sediment or collecting sediment during a certain interval of time $\Delta$t. Because bedload transport rates exhibit significant non-Gaussian fluctuations, their time-averaged rates depend a great deal on $\Delta$t. We begin by exploring this issue theoretically within the framework of Markov processes. We define the bedload transport rate either as the particle flux through a control surface or as a quantity related to the number of moving particles and their velocities in a control volume. These quantities are double averaged; that is, we calculate their ensemble and time averages. Both definitions lead to the same expression for the double-averaged mean rate and to the same scaling for the variance's dependence on the length of the sampling duration $\Delta$t. These findings lead us to propose a protocol for measuring double-averaged transport rates. We apply this protocol to an experiment we ran in a narrow flume using steady-state conditions (constant water discharge and sediment feed rates), in which the time variations in the particle flux, the number of moving particles, and their velocities were measured using high-speed cameras. The data agree well with the previously defined theoretical relationships. Lastly, we apply our experimental protocol to other flow conditions (a long laboratory flume and a gravel-bed river) to show its potential across various contexts.},

Following the initial blast, a pressure wave propagates through the bed, producing high-speed ejecta of grains and ultimately a crater. We analyzed the crater morphology in the context of large-scale explosions and other cratering processes. The process was analyzed in the context of large-scale explosions, and the crater morphology was compared with those resulting from other cratering processes in the same energy range. From this comparison, we deduce that craters formed through different mechanisms can exhibit fine surface features depending on their origin, at least at the laboratory scale. Moreover, unlike laboratory-scale craters produced by the impact of dense spheres, the diameter and depth do not follow a 1/4-power-law scaling with energy, rather the exponent observed herein is approximately 0.30, as has also been found in large-scale events. Regarding the ejecta curtain of grains, its expansion obeys the same time dependence followed by shock waves produced by underground explosions. Finally, from experiments in a two-dimensional system, the early cavity growth is analyzed and compared to a recent study on explosions at the surface of water.},

abstract = {We use interface-resolved direct numerical simulations to study the dynamics of a single sediment particle in a turbulent open channel flow over a fixed porous bed. The relative strength of the gravitational acceleration, quantified by the Galileo number, is varied so as to reproduce the different modes of sediment transport - resuspension, saltation and rolling. The results show that the sediment dynamics at lower Galileo numbers (i.e.resuspension and saltation) are mainly governed by the mean flow. Here, the regime of motion can be predicted by the ratio between the gravity and the shear-induced boundary force. In these cases, the sediment particle rapidly takes off when exposed to the flow, and proceeds with an oscillatory motion. Increasing the Galileo number, the frequency of these oscillations increases and their amplitude decreases, until the transport mode switches from resuspension to saltation. In this case, the sediment travels by short successive collisions with the bed. Further increasing the Galileo number, the particle rolls without detaching from the bed. Differently from the previous modes, the motion is triggered by extreme turbulent events, and the particle response depends on the specific initial conditions, at fixed Reynolds number. The results reveal that close to the onset of sediment motion, only turbulent sweeps can effectively trigger the particle motion by increasing the stagnation pressure upstream. We show that for the parameters in this study, a criterion based on the streamwise flow-induced force can successfully predict the incipient movement.},

abstract = {Some landscapes exhibit the intriguing characteristic that the steepness of hillslopes varies systematically with the direction they face, even where there is no bias introduced by bedrock structure. This topographic asymmetry has inspired numerous explanations. In the simplest scenario, insolation-driven microclimatic differences lead to different erosion rates on opposing slopes and topographic asymmetry develops. Alternatively, lateral channel migration and the corresponding steepening of undercut slopes have also been suggested as a dominant cause of topographic asymmetry. To examine these proposed origins of asymmetric topography, we adapted a numerical landscape evolution model to include lateral channel migration as well as aspect-induced variations in soil creep, regolith strength, and runoff. We compared the resulting topography and erosional response produced by each mechanism and found that the model with lateral channel migration produces unique signatures in erosion rates and the ridgetop Laplacian of elevation. To further investigate lateral channel migration, we developed a model of hillslope profile evolution in which sediment fluxes from opposing slopes control lateral channel migration rate and direction. We find that topographic asymmetry in this system can be self-sustaining. All else being equal, we find that the aspect-dependent models with variable regolith strength or runoff predict that less topographic asymmetry should develop as slope length decreases. These two models also predict that weaker asymmetry should develop as rock strength increases, whereas the lateral channel migration model predicts that greater rock strength should lead to weaker asymmetry only if lateral channel migration efficiency increases faster than fluvial incision efficiency.},

abstract = {We consider an array of units each of which can be in one of three states. Unidirectional transitions between these states are governed by Markovian rate processes. The interactions between units occur through a dependence of the transition rates of a unit on the states of the units with which it interacts. This coupling is nonlocal, that is, it is neither an all-to-all interaction (referred to as global coupling), nor is it a nearest neighbor interaction (referred to as local coupling). The coupling is chosen so as to disfavor the crowding of interacting units in the same state. As a result, there is no global synchronization. Instead, the resultant spatiotemporal configuration is one of clusters that move at a constant speed and that can be interpreted as traveling waves. We develop a mean field theory to describe the cluster formation and analyze this model analytically. The predictions of the model are compared favorably with the results obtained by direct numerical simulations.},

abstract = {Drainage analysis is useful in structural interpretation, particularly in areas of low relief. Analysis includes consideration of drainage patterns, drainage texture, individual stream patterns, and drainage anomalies. Drainage patterns generally are subdivided into basic and modified basic. To these might be added pattern varieties. A basic pattern is one whose gross characteristics readily distinguish it from other basic patterns. Modified basic patterns differ from the type patterns in some fairly obvious regional aspect as, for example, a tendency toward parallelism of the larger tributaries in a dendritic pattern. Thus many modified patterns are transitional in character between basic patterns, and the naming of such patterns may be a matter of judgment. Pattern varieties are characterized by internal details, commonly obscure. In a broad sense, the basic patterns, the modified basic patterns, and the pattern varieties are analogous to the genera, species, and varieties of the zoological classification. A complex pattern consists of two contemporaneous patterns adjacent to each other; a compound pattern consists of two unlike superimposed patterns. The palimpsest pattern consists of two super imposed patterns, but one is a paleopattern. Drainage texture depends on a variety of factors. In any one small area where all other factors are constant, drainage texture may firovide information on underlying materials and indirectly on structure. Individual stream patterns may display characteristics similai- to lho.se of the gross drainage pattern and may be referred to by the same name. Thus individual patterns may be referred to by such terms as rectangular, angulate, or contorted. Other stream patterns include irregular, rectilinear, meandering, braided, misfit, and beaded. Drainage anomalies are local deviations from drainage and stream patterns which elsewhere accord with the known regional geology and/or topography. The expectable pattern is regarded as the norm; the anomalies indicate departures from the regional geologic or topographic controls. Analysis of drainage anomalies has revealed structural data in some ilalland reciions WIKTI' other methods of investigation have been unsatisfactory},

The input models may correspond to triangulated rigid or deformable models and articulated models. Moreover, FCL can perform probabilistic collision checking between noisy point clouds that are captured using cameras or LIDAR sensors. The main benefit of FCL lies in the fact that it provides a unified interface that can be used by various applications. Furthermore, its flexible architecture makes it easier to implement new algorithms within this framework. The runtime performance of the library is comparable to state of the art collision and proximity algorithms. We demonstrate its performance on synthetic datasets as well as motion planning and grasping computations performed using a two-armed mobile manipulation robot. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Definitions of soil particle sphericity, roundness and roughness have existed since at least the 1930s. In the 1950s, charts of typical sphericity and roundness values were developed to alleviate tedious manual determination. They allowed users to classify particles by visual comparison to typical particles possessing ranges of sphericity and roundness. The original definitions and somewhat subjective chart methods are still widely used today. This paper describes robust numerical methods based on computational geometry to determine precisely the traditional values from two-dimensional images of particles. Statistical methods including locally weighted regression and K-fold cross-validation were used to discretise a mean particle surface and thereby quantify and remove roughness. The paper details the algorithms for identifying particle corners and fitting circles to them for computation of roundness. Conclusions are also drawn regarding the most appropriate definition for particle sphericity from among five that are commonly cited. Finally, recommendations are made for the minimum image resolutions and particle perimeter discretisation necessary to obtain accurate results.},

abstract = {Peak rainfalls and peak runoff rates per unit area are comparable over a worldwide spectrum of climates. However, while the magnitude of the external contribution of energy or force in diverse regions is similar, the impact on the landscape varies markedly between regions. Absolute magnitudes of climatic events and absolute time intervals between such events do not provide satisfactory measures of the geomorphic effectiveness of events of different magnitudes and recurrence intervals. Although geomorphic processes are driven by complex sets of interrelated climatic, topo- graphic, lithologic, and biologic factors, the work done by individual extreme events can be scaled as a ratio to mean annual erosion and the effectiveness of such events in forming landscape features can be related to the rate of recovery of channel form or mass wasting scars following alteration by the extreme event. Thus, a time scale for effectiveness may relate the recurrence interval of an event to the time required for a landform to recover the form existing prior to the event. River channels in temperate regions widened by floods of recurrence intervals from 50 to more than 200 years may regain their original width in matters of months or years. In semi-arid regions, recovery of channel form depends not only upon flows but upon climatic determinants of the growth of bottomland vegetation resulting in variable rates of recovery, on the order of decades, depending upon coincidence of average flows and strengthened vegetation. In truly arid regions the absence of vegetation and flow precludes recovery and the width of channels increases in drainage areas up to 100km2 but remains relatively constant at larger drainage areas. Area as well as time controls the effectiveness of specific events inasmuch as the likelihood of simultaneous peak discharges or rainfalls and large areas is less, particularly in arid regions where events spanning areas of more than several thousand km2 are extremely rare if experienced at all. To some extent a decrease in area in a humid region is comparable with a regional change from humid toward more arid climate reflected in the increase in importance of episodic as contrasted with more continuous processes. Exceedingly rare floods of extreme magnitudes, estimated recurrence intervals of 500 years or longer, may exceed thresholds of competence otherwise unattainable in the ‘normal' record resulting in ‘irreparable' transformations of valley landforms. Denudation of hillslopes by mass wasting during relatively rare events can also be related to mean rates of denudation and to recovery of hillslope surfaces after scarring by different kinds of landslides. Measured recovery times described in the literature vary from less than a decade for some tropical regions to decades or more in temperate regions. Recurrence intervals of high magnitude storms which trigger mass wasting range from 1 to 2 years in some tropical areas, to 3 or 4 per hundred years in some areas of seasonal rainfall and to 100 or more years in some temperate regions. The effectiveness of climatic events on both hillslopes and rivers is not separable from gradient, lithology or other variables which control both thresholds of activity and recovery rate.},

abstract = {Sediment transport occurs when the nondimensional fluid shear stress $\Theta$ at the bed surface exceeds a minimum value $\Theta$c. A large collection of data, known as the Shields curve, shows that $\Theta$c is primarily a function of the shear Reynolds number Re∗. It is commonly assumed that $\Theta${\textgreater}$\Theta$c(Re∗) occurs when the Re∗-dependent fluid forces are too large to maintain static equilibrium for a typical surface grain. A complimentary approach, which remains relatively unexplored, is to identify $\Theta$c(Re∗) as the applied shear stress at which grains cannot stop moving. With respect to grain dynamics, Re∗ can be viewed as the viscous time scale for a grain to equilibrate to the fluid flow divided by the typical time for the fluid force to accelerate a grain over the characteristic bed roughness. We performed simulations of granular beds sheared by a model fluid, varying only these two time scales. We find that the critical Shields number $\Theta$c(Re∗) obtained from the model mimics the Shields curve and is insensitive to the grain properties, the model fluid flow, and the form of the drag law. Quantitative discrepancies between the model results and the Shields curve are consistent with previous calculations of lift forces at varying Re∗. Grains at low Re∗ find more stable configurations than those at high Re∗ due to differences in the grain reorganization dynamics. Thus, instead of focusing on mechanical equilibrium of a typical grain at the bed surface, $\Theta$c(Re∗) may be better described by the stress at which mobile grains cannot find a stable configuration and stop moving.},

We find that packing fraction is generally higher for geometrically nonfrustrated regular polygons, and can be increased by the increase of edge number and decrease of friction. The changes of packing fraction are linked with those of the microstructures, such as the variations of the translational and orientational orders and local configurations. In particular, the free areas of Voronoi tessellations (which are related to local packing fractions) can be described by log-normal distributions for all polygons.

The effect of particle shape is evidenced by comparing the data from pentagon packing and from a packing with identical characteristics, except for the circular shape of the particles. A counterintuitive finding of this work is that, under steady shearing, the pentagon packing develops a lower structural anisotropy than the disk packing. We show that this weakness is compensated by a higher force anisotropy, leading to enhanced shear strength of the pentagon packing. We revisit "strong" and "weak" force networks in the pentagon packing, but our simulation data also provide evidence for a large class of "very weak" forces carried mainly by vertex-to-edge contacts. The strong force chains are mostly composed of edge-to-edge contacts with a marked zigzag aspect and a decreasing exponential probability distribution as in a disk packing. {\textcopyright} 2007 The American Physical Society.},

Particles are superballs with shape |x|s+|y|s+|z|s=1 that varies from sphere (s=2) to cube (s=), constructed with an overlapping-sphere model. Both packing fraction, $\phi$, and coordination number, z, decrease monotonically with microscopic friction $\mu$, for all shapes. However, this decrease is more dramatic for larger s due to a reduction in the fraction of face-face contacts with increasing friction. For flowing grains, the dynamic friction $\mu$ - the ratio of shear to normal stresses - depends on shape, microscopic friction, and inertial number I. For all shapes, $\mu$ grows from its quasistatic value $\mu$0 as ($\mu$-$\mu$0)=dI$\alpha$, with different universal behavior for frictional and frictionless shapes. For frictionless shapes the exponent $\alpha$≈0.5 and prefactor d≈5$\mu$0 while for frictional shapes $\alpha$≈1 and d varies only slightly. The results highlight that the flow exponents are universal and are consistent for all the shapes simulated here.},

We find that the shear strength is independent of the size span, but unexpectedly, it declines with increasing shape polydispersity. At the same time, the solid fraction is an increasing function of both the size span and the shape polydispersity. Hence, the densest and loosest packings have the same shear strength. At the scale of the particles and their contacts, we analyze the connectivity of particles, force transmission, and friction mobilization as well as their anisotropies. We show that stronger forces are carried by larger particles and propped by an increasing number of small particles. The independence of shear strength with regard to size span is shown to be a consequence of contact network self-organization, with the falloff of contact anisotropy compensated by increasing force anisotropy.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional discrete numerical simulation is used to investigate the properties of close-packed frictionless granular assemblies as a function of particle polydispersity and shape. Unlike some experimental results, simulations show that disordered packings of pinacoids (eight-face convex polyhedra) achieve higher solid fraction values than amorphous packings of spherical or rounded particles, thus fulfilling the analog of Ulam's conjecture stated by Jiao and co-workers for random packings [Y. Jiao and S. Torquato, Phys. Rev. E 84, 041309 (2011)PLEEE81539-375510.1103/PhysRevE.84.041309]. This seeming discrepancy between experimental and numerical results is believed to result from difficulties in overcoming inter particle friction through experimental densification processes. Moreover, solid fraction is shown to increase further with bidispersity and peak when the volume proportion of small particles reaches 30{\%}. Contrarily, substituting up to 50{\%} of flat pinacoids for isometric ones yields solid fraction decrease, especially when flat particles are also elongated. Nevertheless, particle shape seems to play a minor role in packing solid fraction compared to polydispersity. Additional investigations focused on the packing microstructure confirm that pinacoid packings fulfill the isostatic conjecture and that they are free of order except beyond 30{\%} to 50{\%} of flat or flat-elongated polyhedra in the packing. This order increase progressively takes the form of a nematic phase caused by the reorientation of flat or flat-elongated particles to minimize the packing potential energy. Simultaneously, this reorientation seems to increase the solid fraction value slightly above the maximum achieved by monodisperse isometric pinacoids, as well as the coordination number. Finally, partial substitution of elongated pinacoids for isometric ones has limited effect on packing solid fraction or order.},

abstract = {A numerical investigation of particle shape effects on fabric of granular packing is carried out using the three dimensional discrete element method with a superellipsoid model. A broad range of particle shapes controlled by two shape parameters (i.e., aspect ratio and blockiness) are taken into account. A series of random packing of non-cohesive, frictional monodisperse superellipsoids is conducted under gravitational forces in simulations. Fabric of a granular packing is quantified in terms of packing density, coordination number, distribution of particle orientations, anisotropy of three types of fabric vectors (i.e., particle orientation, contact normal and branch vector), and distribution of normalized contact forces. It is shown that the effects of particle shape on packing density and mean coordination number are in agreement with the reported in the literature. Moreover, ellipsoids show the lowest packing density in the family of superellipsoids. The distribution of particle orientations is much more sensitive to blockiness than aspect ratio. It is also found out that anisotropy of both particle orientations and contact normals shows a similar M-type relationship with aspect ratio, two times larger than that of branch vectors. Interestingly, particle shape has an insignificant effect on the probability distribution of normalized contact forces which shows a clear exponential distribution. Those findings would be useful for a better understanding of the initial fabric of granular packing, especially in granular mechanics and geomechanics.},

abstract = {Abstract: By means of molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the texture and local ordering in sheared packings composed of cohesionless platy particles. The morphology of large packings of platy particles in quasistatic equilibrium is complex due to the combined effects of local nematic ordering of the particles and anisotropic orientations of contacts between particles. We find that particle alignment is strongly enhanced by the degree of platyness and leads to the formation of face-connected clusters of exponentially decaying size. Interestingly, due to dynamics in continuous shearing, this ordering phenomenon emerges even in systems composed of particles of very low platyness differing only slightly from spherical shape. The number of clusters is an increasing function of platyness. However, at high platyness the proportion of face-face interactions is too low to allow for their percolation throughout the system.

Subsequently, we propose a model accounting for the effects of turbulence on aerodynamic entrainment based on the distribution of local shear stress to describe the experimental results. We also provide evidence that aerodynamic entrainment can be an efficient way to directly induce a horizontal grain transport comparable to the steady and saturated saltation in unsaturated conditions and should not be ignored.

Previous studies have linked a variety of sediment-supply proxies to climatic, topographic, or geologic factors, but few have connected these directly to the characteristics of fluvial systems draining these landscapes. Here we correlate landscape controls on sediment supply to observed sedimentology and channel patterns through direct measurements of water and sediment fluxes in over 80 drainage basins ranging in area from 1.4 to 35,000 km2 in the northern Rocky Mountains, USA. These data show that the relative sediment supply, defined by the bankfull sediment concentration, is dominated by basin lithology, while exhibiting little correlation to factors such as relief, mean basin slope, and drainage density. Bankfull sediment concentrations (bed load and suspended load) increase as much as 100-fold as basin lithology becomes dominated by softer sedimentary and volcanic rocks, relative to basins with more resistant lithologies. As bed load concentrations increase, stream beds become less armored, and bed load grain size coarsens. At very high sediment concentrations, bed surface, subsurface, and bed load grain sizes converge and a transition from single-thread to to braided channel patterns is commonly observed. Key Points Contemporary sediment concentrations correlate most strongly with lithology As bed load concentrations increase streams become less armored Braiding occurs at the highest concentrations near the limit of bed armoring {\textcopyright}2013.

To quickly identify pairs of particles in contact, the method first uses a broad-phase and a narrow-phase contact detection strategy. After this, a contact resolution phase finds the contact normal and penetration depth. A new algorithm is introduced to effectively locate the contact point in the geometric center of flat faces in partial contact. This is important for a correct evaluation of the torque on each particle, leading to a much higher stability of stacks of particles than with previous algorithms. The granular DEM is used to generate random packings in a cylindrical vessel. The simulated shapes include non-spherical particles with different aspect ratio cuboids, cylinders and ellipsoids. More complex polyhedral shapes representing sand and woodchip particles are also used. The latter particles all have a unique shape and size, resembling real granular particle packings.

abstract = {Stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (PIV) configured in two orthogonal planes was utilised to capture the flow structure at the instant of entrainment of spherical bed particles in open-channel flow. Experiments were conducted with lightweight target particles amongst a bed of coplanar fixed spheres with diameters of 16A mm. The protrusions of the target particles were set to give an average entrainment rate of. These protrusions were established from extensive initial experiments which utilised an automated mechanism to place spheres on the bed of the flume and record the time elapsed until they were entrained by the flow. The results showed that at lower flow depth to particle diameter ratios, bed particles are more stable and require larger protrusions to entrain at the same rate as at a larger depth. This effect is consistent with observations of reduced velocity variance and reduced drag force variance for lower flow submergences. The PIV measurements indicated that particle entrainment is associated with very large-scale motions which extend up to 50 flow depths in the streamwise direction. Contributions of smaller scale velocity and pressure spatial fluctuations are suppressed by a spatial averaging effect related to the particle size, and a temporal averaging effect related to the time taken to fully entrain a particle from its resting pocket. These observations are relevant to sediment transport modelling. However, further data are required to clarify the role of particle lift forces and particle shape in the entrainment process.},

abstract = {Sediment transport equations typically produce transport rates that are biased by orders of magnitude. A causal component of this inaccuracy is the inability to represent complex grain-scale interactions controlling entrainment. Grain-scale incipient motion has long been modelled using geometric relationships based on simplified particle geometry and two-dimensional (2D) force or moment balances. However, this approach neglects many complexities of real grains, including grain shape, cohesion and the angle of entrainment relative to flow direction. To better represent this complexity, we develop the first vector-based, fully three-dimensional (3D) grain rotation entrainment model that can be used to resolve any entrainment formulation in 3D, and which also includes the effect of matrix cohesion. To apply this model we use X-ray computed tomography to quantify the 3D structure of water-worked river grains. We compare our 3D model results with those derived from application of a 2D entrainment model. We find that the 2D approach produces estimates of dimensionless critical shear stress ($\tau$*cr) that are an order of magnitude lower than our 3D model. We demonstrate that it is more appropriate to use the c-axis when calculating 2D projections, which increases values of $\tau$*cr to more closely match our 3D estimates. The 3D model reveals that the main controls on critical shear stress in our samples are projection of grains, cohesive effects from a fine-grained matrix, and bearing angle for the plane of rotation (the lateral angle of departure from downstream flow that, in part, defines the grain's direction of pivot about an axis formed by two contact points in 3D). The structural precision of our 3D model demonstrates sources of geometric error inherent in 2D models. By improving flow properties to better replicate local hydraulics in our 3D model, entrainment modelling of scanned riverbed grains has the potential for benchmarking 2D model enhancements. {\textcopyright} 2019 The Authors.

The motion of coarse spherical glass beads entrained by a shallow turbulent water flow down a steep two-dimensional channel with a mobile bed was experimentally investigated. Focus was put on bed load equilibrium flows, that is, neither erosion nor deposition of particles over sufficiently long time intervals occurred. Flows were filmed from the side by a highspeed camera. Using an image processing software made it possible to determine the flow characteristics such as particle trajectories, their state of motion (rest, rolling or saltating motion) and flow depth. Our first striking result was that, over short time periods, bed load transport appeared as a very intermittent process. Whereas for moderate slopes particles were mainly transported in saltation, the rolling regime was dominant for steep slopes. {\textcopyright} 2005 Taylor {\&} Francis Group.},

For a narrow unimodal sediment distribution, we calculated fluid stress and measured sediment flux for a range of hydrograph durations, magnitudes, shapes, and sequences. Within a hydrograph, we find considerable variability in sediment flux for a given stress above the threshold for motion. However, cumulative bed load flux resulting from a flood scales linearly with the integrated excess transport capacity (flow impulse). This scaling indicates that, to first order, flow magnitude, duration, shape, and sequence are only relevant to bed load flux in terms of their contribution to the total flow impulse, in agreement with prior field results. The flood impulse represents a quantitative parameter through which the effects of transient flow on coarse sediment transport may be parsed.},

We consider two velocity profiles for the fluid, parabolic and logarithmic. The first one models laminar flow and the second corresponds to turbulent flow. For each case we investigate the behavior of the saturated flux. We find that for the logarithmic profile, the saturated flux shows a quadratic increase with the strength of the flow, and for parabolic profile, a cubic increase. The velocity distribution functions are used to interpret the results. {\textcopyright} 2008 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {We analyze the averaged dynamics of a system which jumps within a predefined set of dynamical modes at random time instants. In between the jumps, the dynamics is not necessarily exponential. The residence times are specific for the dynamical modes and they are distributed according to general probability densities. The transitions between the modes are controlled by a matrix of transition probabilities and they generally depend on the residence times in the individual dynamical modes. Our approach is based on the explicit construction of all possible realizations of the system dynamics together with their corresponding probabilities. We give a closed formula for the averaged dynamics and we discuss the physical meaning of the probabilistic elements incorporated. The general scheme is employed in two physically relevant situations, namely, within a model of thermally activated escape including random fluctuations of the barrier height, and in the framework of the optical Bloch equations taking into account fluctuations of the resonance frequency.},

abstract = {Steep mountain streams have channel morphologies that transition from alternate bar to step-pool to cascade with increasing bed slope, which affect stream habitat, flow resistance, and sediment transport. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that alternate bars form under large channel width-to-depth ratios, step-pools form in near supercritical flow or when channel width is narrow compared to bed grain size, and cascade morphology is related to debris flows. However, the connection between these process variables and bed slope—the apparent dominant variable for natural stream types—is unclear. Combining field data and theory, we find that certain bed slopes have unique channel morphologies because the process variables covary systematically with bed slope. Multiple stable states are predicted for other ranges in bed slope, suggesting that a competition of underlying processes leads to the emergence of the most stable channel form.},

abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of duration, in addition to magnitude, of energetic turbulent events on particle dislodgement under threshold of motion conditions. It is therefore proposed here that the use of turbulence sequences, instead of single instantaneous extreme events, is more appropriate for characterizing the role of fluctuating velocities and associated hydrodynamic forces on particle mobility. The validity of the proposed method is examined through the detailed analysis of directly measured velocity and pressure data sets. In an effort to relate the results of the conventional velocity quadrant analysis with the instantaneous pressure measurements, the concept of pressure quadrant analysis is introduced. The coupled sequences of the synchronous velocity and pressure quadrant events allow for a more complete description of the local turbulent flow characteristics, including the prevalent coherent structures, and more clear interpretation of their role on particle mobility. It is concluded here that large-scale sweep structures are capable of generating excessive and persistent force fluctuations which are predominantly responsible for the dynamic process of particle dislodgement. This result supports the impulse criterion as the proper way of accounting for the cumulative effect of coherent structures on particle movement.},

For regular particles like spheres and ellipsoids, the mathematics are straightforward. For random particles, with realistic shapes, mathematically characterizing the shape had not been generally done. But since about the year 2002, a method has been developed that combines X-ray computed tomography and spherical harmonic analysis to give analytical, differentiable mathematical functions for the three-dimensional shape of star-shape particles, which are a wide class of particles covering most industrial particles of interest, ranging from micrometer scale to millimeter scale particles. This review article describes how this is done, in some detail, and then gives examples of applications of this method, including a contact function that is suitable for these random shape particles. The purpose of this article is to make these ideas widely available for the general powder researcher who knows that particle shape is important to his/her applications, and especially for those researchers who are just starting out in their particle science and technology careers.},

abstract = {A new criterion for the onset of entrainment of coarse sediment grains is presented here. It is hypothesized that not only the magnitude, but also the duration of energetic near bed turbulent events is relevant in predicting grain removal from the bed surface. It is therefore proposed that the product of force and its duration, or impulse, is a more appropriate and universal criterion for identifying conditions for particle dislodgement. This conjecture is investigated utilizing two theoretical models, representative of two modes of entrainment: saltation and rolling. In these models, instantaneous, highly fluctuating turbulent forces are simulated as short‐lived pulses of characteristic magnitude and duration, which transfer adequate fluid momentum to the particle, to trigger its entrainment. The analytical solution of the respective equations of motion is employed in deriving representations of threshold conditions in terms of the impulse characteristics. It is shown that hydrodynamic forces of sufficiently high magnitude are capable of entraining a particle only when they last long enough so that their impulse exceeds a critical value. To illustrate further the validity of the critical impulse concept, as well as extend and generalize its application to different entrainment levels of an individual grain, a novel experimental setup is utilized. This setup facilitates observations of angular displacement of a steel mobile particle in air due to electromagnetic pulses of different magnitude and duration. The experimentally obtained conditions for partial or complete entrainment support the concept of a critical impulse.},

@article{Zimmermann2010,
abstract = {We investigate the stability of steppool channels by examining how the traditional approach to bed stability based on the critical Shields number is modified by particles jamming across the width of the channel. Experiments were conducted in a flume with slopes ranging between 3{\%} and 18{\%} and either smooth or rough walls. By varying the size of sediment and width of the flume we observed that the stability of the bed increases as the jamming ratio (channel width/D84step is the diameter at which 84{\%} of the step stones are smaller) decreases for jamming ratios less than six. At low jamming ratios both grain ongrain structuring and sediment entrainment phenomena affect the stability of the bed. Actual bed failure, however, depends upon the history of bed development and the chance arrangement of the stone structures in the bed. Thus, the experiments also demonstrate that the inherently stochastic nature of sediment transport affects not only the movement of individual grains but also the stability of the channel as a whole. Since stochastic processes affect the stability of the entire channel, there is no clearly defined separation between stable and unstable beds, rather, an overlapping field where both stable and unstable bed states can exist. This field was modeled using logistic regression to derive a probability of bed failure. A comparison of data from experiments with rough banks and smooth banks showed that rough banks significantly increase the stability of the bed.},

Grain position, velocity and acceleration were measured with particle-scale resolution; ensemble statistics over a significant sample of particle trajectories were then computed, enabling unsteady phases of particle motion (corresponding to entrainment and disentrainment) to be identified. Based on the experimental findings, a physically-based conceptual model for particle kinematics consisting of an initial (entrainment) unsteady phase, a quasi-steady phase, and a final (disentrainment) unsteady phase is explored. The unsteadiness effects in particle dispersion due to entrainment and disentrainment, typically overlooked in previous studies, are explicitly quantified by analysing the time evolution of the particle position variance. Starting with a previously published model of particle diffusion, a refined model is proposed which explicitly accounts for the unsteadiness effects in particle motion.},

abstract = {Data from laboratory flumes and natural streams show that the critical Shields stress for initial sediment motion increases with channel slope, which indicates that particles of the same size are more stable on steeper slopes. This observation is contrary to standard models that predict reduced stability with increasing slope due to the added downstream gravitational force. Processes that might explain this discrepancy are explored using a simple force-balance model, including increased drag from channel walls and bed morphology, variable friction angles, grain emergence, flow aeration, and changes to the local flow velocity and turbulent fluctuations. Surprisingly, increased drag due to changes in bed morphology does not appear to be the cause of the slope dependency because both the magnitude and trend of the critical Shields stress are similar for flume experiments and natural streams, and significant variations in bed morphology in flumes is unlikely. Instead, grain emergence and changes in local flow velocity and turbulent fluctuations seem to be responsible for the slope dependency due to the coincident increase in the ratio of bed-roughness scale to flow depth (i.e., relative roughness). A model for the local velocity within the grain-roughness layer is proposed based on a 1-D eddy viscosity with wake mixing. In addition, the magnitude of near-bed turbulent fluctuations is shown to depend on the depth-averaged flow velocity and the relative roughness. Extension of the model to mixed grain sizes indicates that the coarser fraction becomes increasingly difficult to transport on steeper slopes. Copyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {[1] This study empirically quantified the effect of sampling time on measured transport rates and fitted rating curves based on results obtained from bed load traps deployed for 2, 10, and 60 min in a coarse-bedded stream. As expected for a skewed distribution of transport rates, 2 min deployment underpredicted transport rates obtained from 10 and 60 min deployment by factors of 2 and 3 at moderate flows (50-70{\%} Qbkf). At near-bank-full flow the underprediction by 2 min versus 10 min sampling increased to a factor of 5, while transport rates collected during 60 min deployments were reduced because of overfilled bags. At flows near incipient gravel motion, 2 min sampling overpredicted transport rates obtained by 10 and 60 min deployment by factors of 2.7 and 3.4. The overprediction is attributed to computational effects arising mainly from the lowest measurable transport rate for each sampling time. Rating curves fitted to transport rates from 2 min sampling were significantly less steep than those for longer deployment times. However, sampling time explains only a small degree of the large difference between rating curves from bed load traps and a Helley-Smith sampler (2 min sampling).

abstract = {Measurement and estimation of bed load transport in gravel bed rivers are highly affected by its temporal fluctuations. Such variability is primarily driven by the flow regime but is also associated with a variety of inherent channel processes, such as flow turbulence, grain entrainment, and bed forms migration. These internal and external controls often act at comparable time scales, and are therefore difficult to disentangle, thus hindering the study of bed load variability under unsteady flow regime. In this paper, we report on laboratory experiments performed in a large, mobile bed flume where typical hydromorphological conditions of gravel bed rivers were reproduced. Data from a large number of replicated runs, including triangular and square-wave hydrographs, were used to build a statistically sound description of sediment transport processes. We found that the inherent variability of bed load flux strongly depends on the sampling interval, and it is significantly higher in complex, wandering or braided channels. This variability can be filtered out by computing the mean response over the experimental replicates, which allows us to highlight two distinctive phenomena: (i) an overshooting (undershooting) response of the mean bed load flux to a sudden increase (decrease) of discharge, and (ii) a clockwise hysteresis in the sediment rating curve. We then provide an interpretation of these findings through a conceptual mathematical model, showing how both phenomena are associated with a lagging morphological adaptation to unsteady flow. Overall, this work provides basic information for evaluating, monitoring, and managing gravel transport in morphologically active rivers.},

abstract = {An improved synthetic digital filtering method (SDFM) for the generation of equilibrium turbulence is described, with emphasis on the ease of application to complex configurations. This is achieved by facilitating the use of modeled (RANS) statistics for the mean flow and Reynolds stress profiles, instead of simulated (DNS or LES) statistics that are not readily available for three-dimensional flows. The effects on boundary layer relaxation with modeled statistics are first quantified for a well-known canonical situation, specifically, Mach 2 equilibrium turbulent boundary layers over 250 {\textless} Re$\theta$ {\textless} 2220. Various convergence criteria are assessed in terms of the streamwise coordinate (x) normalized by the incoming boundary layer thickness ($\delta$0). These include skin-friction, which requires x/$\delta$0 ≈ 12 for equilibrium, inner scale mean velocity (x/$\delta$0 ≈ 16), inner scale Reynolds stresses (x/$\delta$0 ≈ 18), as well as outer scale mean velocity, Reynolds stresses, and spatio-temporal correlations (x/$\delta$0 ≈ 40–50). Development lengths are shown to be inversely related to Reynolds number. In terms of boundary layer relaxation length, initializing the method with RANS (versus simulated) statistics incurs a negligible penalty in inner coordinates and a mild penalty (x/$\delta$0 ≈ 5–10) in outer coordinates. The effectiveness of this approach is then demonstrated by application to significantly more complex three-dimensional flows, including internal single and multi-stream flows, for which synthetic turbulence generation techniques are necessary, but precursor high-fidelity simulations are not available. Thus, the RANS-initialized SDFM provides a rapidly adaptable method for the synthetic generation of wall-bounded turbulence.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic modification of forests has often decoupled streams from riparian ecosystems and altered natural wood recruitment processes. Extensive research has shown that large wood significantly impacts channel dynamics, especially in small and intermediate sized forested streams where wood pieces are similar in length to channel width, and many stream rehabilitation efforts now involve the addition of large wood to streams. The primary objective of this research is to investigate the relation between large wood and reach scale channel morphology and hydraulics using a physical model, in order to better inform stream rehabilitation programs and future modeling efforts. Four experiments, each comprising numerous five hour runs, were conducted using a Froude-scaled stream table with wood loads scaled to 0m3/m2, 0.011m3/m2, 0.016m3/m2, and 0.022m3/m2. The addition of large wood significantly decreased the reach-averaged velocity in all experiments, and was associated with decreased sediment transport and increased sediment storage in the reach. Increases in bed and water surface slope compensated for the loss of energy available to transport sediment, and enabled the system to reach a new steady state within the equivalent of 6 to 9years. Adding wood increased pool frequency, as well as the variability in cross-sectional depth, while causing the reach to undergo a transition from a plane-bed to a riffle-pool morphology. Retention of fine sediment increased the availability of fish spawning substrate, while increased water stage improved connectivity between the channel and the floodplain. The changes in habitat complexity were generally related to the wood load added to the reach, but were also dependent on the orientation and arrangement of the pieces. These results demonstrate that wood may exert a primary control on channel morphodynamics and the availability of aquatic habitat in intermediate sized streams, and suggest that the benefits from stream rehabilitation efforts are highly dependent on project scale. The relatively long time needed to realize habitat benefits demonstrates that long term monitoring of rehabilitation projects is necessary. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

In that effort, Einstein personified the mix of success and frustration experienced by many researchers who have attempted to formulate the complicated behavior of alluvial rivers in terms of mechanically based equations. His formulation of the relationship between rates of bed-sediment transport (especially bedload transport) and water flow comprised an innovative departure from the largely empirical approach that prevailed at the time. He introduced into that relationship the emerging fluid-mechanic concepts of turbulence and boundary layers, and concepts of probability theory. Inevitably the numerous complexities attending sediment transport mire formulation and prompt his use of several approximating compromises in order to make estimating bed-sediment transport practicable. His formulation nonetheless is a milestone in river engineering. {\textcopyright} ASCE / JUNE 2004.},

abstract = {A series of flume experiments were conducted to study the effect of bed form dynamics on the flow over a gravel bed comprising a wide distribution of grain sizes. Instantaneous high-frequency streamwise flow velocities were sampled using an acoustic Doppler velocimeter at a frequency of 200 Hz, while the simultaneous bed elevations were sampled using sonar transducers at a frequency of 0.2 Hz for a duration of 20 h. Spectral analysis of the measured velocity fluctuations reveals the existence of two distinct power law scaling regimes. At high frequencies, an inertial subrange of turbulence with ∼-5/3 Kolmogorov scaling is observed. At low frequencies, another scaling regime with spectral slope of about -1.1 is found. We interpret this range as the signature of the evolving multiscale bed topography on the near-bed velocity fluctuations. The two scaling ranges are separated by a spectral gap, i.e., a range of intermediate scales with no additional energy contribution. The high-frequency limit of the spectral gap corresponds to the integral scale of turbulence. The low-frequency end of the gap corresponds to the scale of the smallest bed forms identified by the velocity sensor, which depends on the position of the sensor. Our results also show that the temporal scales of the largest bed forms can be potentially identified from spectral analysis of low-resolution velocity measurements collected near the channel bed.},

Only literature concerning alluvial and semi-alluvial channels is analyzed herein (bedrock channels and debris flow processes are not treated). The paper first addresses the morphological configurations of steep channels, including classification issues, step definition and mechanisms for step formation. Second, the relevant recent literature dealing with flow hydrodynamics in steep streams is presented, with particular emphasis given to flow regimes and resistance partitioning. Third, a review of bedload transport processes is provided that highlights the strong relations amongst hydrodynamics, bed stability, sediment supply, and transport rates in these systems. Even though over the recent years the number of investigations on the dynamics of steep streams has soared, our understanding and the associated models (conceptual and empirical) are still far from being satisfactory. More effort should be dedicated to develop innovative, long-term field measurements as well as flume tests more representative of the complex dynamics typical of steep channels. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {We provide a probabilistic definition of the bed load sediment flux. In treating particle positions and motions as stochastic quantities, a flux form of the Master equation (a general expression of conservation) reveals that the volumetric flux involves an advective part equal to the product of an average particle velocity and the particle activity (the solid volume of particles in motion per unit streambed area), and a diffusive part involving the gradient of the product of the particle activity and a diffusivity that arises from the second moment of the probability density function of particle displacements. Gradients in the activity, instantaneous or time-averaged, therefore effect a particle flux. Time-averaged descriptions of the flux involve averaged products of the particle activity, the particle velocity and the diffusivity; the significance of these products depends on the scale of averaging. The flux form of the Exner equation looks like a Fokker-Planck equation (an advection-diffusion form of the Master equation). The entrainment form of the Exner equation similarly involves advective and diffusive terms, but because it is based on the joint probability density function of particle hop distances and associated travel times, this form involves a time derivative term that represents a lag effect associated with the exchange of particles between the static and active states. The formulation is consistent with experimental measurements and simulations of particle motions reported in companion papers. {\textcopyright} 2012. American Geophysical Union.

abstract = {A method is presented which enables the computation of the bedload transport as the product of the saltation height, the particle velocity and the bed-load concentration. The equations of motions for a solitary particle are solved numerically to determine the saltation height and particle velocity. Experiments with gravel particles (transported as bed load) are selected to calibrate the mathematical model using the lift coefficient as a free parameter. The model is used to compute the saltation heights and lengths for a range of flow conditions. The computational results are used to determine simple relationships for the saltation characteristics. Measured transport rates of the bed load are used to compute the sediment concentration in the bed-load layer. A simple expression specifying the bed-load concentration as a function of the flow and sediment conditions is proposed. A verification analysis using about 600 (alternative) data shows that about 77{\%} of the predicted bed load-transport rates are within 0.5 and 2 times the observed values. {\textcopyright} ASCE.},

The packing density 1/6$\pi$N$\sigma$3/V and the mean coordination number both decrease with distance from the center; the large-aggregate limits are, respectively, 0.61 (extrapolated, 4{\%} lower than the ball-bearing value), and exactly 6.0 (in agreement with the ball-bearing value). The apparent difficulty of homogeneously nucleating crystallization in hard-sphere systems, even when simultaneous relaxation of many particle positions is allowed, is attributed to the fact that small hcp and fcc fragments are more bulky and have no more hard contacts than amorphous arragements of the same number of atoms. {\textcopyright} 1972 The American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {In cloud modeling studies, the time evolution of droplet size distributions due to collision-coalescence events is usually modeled with the Smoluchowski coagulation equation, also known as the kinetic collection equation (KCE). However, the KCE is a deterministic equation with no stochastic fluctuations or correlations. Therefore, the full stochastic description of cloud droplet growth in a coalescing system must be obtained from the solution of the multivariate master equation, which models the evolution of the state vector for the number of droplets of a given mass. Unfortunately, due to its complexity, only limited results were obtained for certain types of kernels and monodisperse initial conditions. In this work, a novel numerical algorithm for the solution of the multivariate master equation for stochastic coalescence that works for any type of kernels, multivariate initial conditions and small system sizes is introduced. The performance of the method was seen by comparing the numerically calculated particle mass spectrum with analytical solutions of the master equation obtained for the constant and sum kernels. Correlation coefficients were calculated for the turbulent hydrodynamic kernel, and true stochastic averages were compared with numerical solutions of the kinetic collection equation for that case. The results for collection kernels depending on droplet mass demonstrates that the magnitudes of correlations are significant and must be taken into account when modeling the evolution of a finite volume coalescing system.},

Object tracking, in general, is a challenging problem. Difficulties in tracking objects can arise due to abrupt object motion, changing appearance patterns of both the object and the scene, nonrigid object structures, object-to-object and object-to-scene occlusions, and camera motion. Tracking is usually performed in the context of higher-level applications that require the location and/or shape of the object in every frame. Typically, assumptions are made to constrain the tracking problem in the context of a particular application. In this survey, we categorize the tracking methods on the basis of the object and motion representations used, provide detailed descriptions of representative methods in each category, and examine their pros and cons. Moreover, we discuss the important issues related to tracking including the use of appropriate image features, selection of motion models, and detection of objects. {\textcopyright} 2006 ACM.},

We have validated through laboratory experiments and analytical formulation of the problem a criterion based upon the impulse imparted to a sediment grain. We demonstrate that in addition to the magnitude of the instantaneous turbulent forces applied on a sediment grain, the duration of these turbulent forces is also important in determining the sediment grain's threshold of motion, and that their product, or impulse, is better suited for specifying such conditions.},

Therefore, the probability of particles staying in each layer can be obtained by the proposed model, which can then be used to quantify the number of particles, and the bedload and suspended load transport rate, respectively. In addition, since the finer particles are more likely sheltered by coarse particles on the bed, mixed-size particles are considered in this paper to account for such an effect. The influence of dimensionless effective shear stress on the mean transient rates, representing the average rate of particle transitions among the immobile bed material, bedload layer, and suspended load layer, is quantified and discussed.

abstract = {Field observations in streams with beds of coarse sand and fine gravel have revealed that bedload moves primarily as thin, migrating accumulations of sediment, and coarse grains cluster at their leading edge. These accumulations are one or two coarse grains high and are much longer (0.2-0.6 m long in sand; 0.5-2.0 m in fine gravel) than their height. We propose the term "bedload sheet" for these features, and we argue that they result from an instability inherent to bedload movement of moderately and poorly sorted sediment. In essence, coarse particles in the bedload slow or stop each other, trap finer particles in their interstices, and thus cause the coarse particles to become mobile again. Bedload sheets develop on the stoss side of dunes, causing the dune to advance incrementally with the arrival of each sheet. Successive deposition of coarse sediment from the leading edge followed by fine sediment may generate the grain-size sorting that distinguishes cross-bedding. Available flume experiments and field observations indicate that bedload sheets are a common, but generally unrecognized, feature of heterogeneous sediment transport. {\textcopyright} 1988 Geological Society of America.},

abstract = {Substantial variations in the particle flux are commonly observed in field measurements on gravel-bed rivers and in laboratory experiments mimicking river behavior on a smaller scale. These fluctuations can be explained by the natural variability of sediment supply and hydraulic conditions. We conducted laboratory experiments of particle transport down a two-dimensional inclined channel, for which the boundary conditions were properly controlled. Most flow variables and the features of particle trajectories were measured using a high-speed camera. The particles were 6-mm glass beads entrained by a rapid, turbulent, supercritical water flow. Even under these well-controlled experimental conditions and despite steady supply, solid discharge exhibited significant variations with time. The objective of this paper was to pinpoint the origins of these fluctuations by investigating different flow conditions. Two experiments were done with a fixed (smooth or corrugated) channel bottom and two others were run with a mobile bed (involving layers of closely packed particles lying along the channel base, which could be entrained by the stream); in the latter case, two particle arrangements were tested. It was found that, to a large extent, fluctuations reflected the finite size of the observation window. For fixed beds, the characteristic time scale of fluctuations and their probability distribution can be predetermined by evaluating the mean and fluctuating velocities of a single particle. Solid-discharge fluctuations were exacerbated when the bed was mobile because (i) the moving solid phase and the stationary bed exchanged particles and (ii) collective entrainment of particles occurred. {\textcopyright} 2004 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Initiation of bed-load transport of uniform spherical sediment particles on a horizontal bed in an open-channel flow is studied. On the basis of micromechanical and fluid dynamical considerations, two separate criteria for the initiation of motion are derived: one for rolling and one for lifting. Fluid forces such as drag, shear lift, Magnus lift, and lift due to centrifugal force are included in the derivation. The formulation of the lift force is theoretical. No empirical coefficient is used other than the drag coefficient C{\textless}inf{\textgreater}d{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} which is well established in the literature. In the low particle Reynolds number regime, where u{\textless}inf{\textgreater}*{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}d/v≤1, the dimensionless stress required to initiate lifting is found to be much higher than that of rolling, the former substantially above the Shields' curve while the latter is substantially below it. The theory is compared with Vanoni's 1964 data, with meaningful results. For higher particle Reynolds number, where u{\textless}inf{\textgreater}*{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}d/v {\textgreater} 10, the dimensionless stress needed to initiate lifting is closer to that of rolling. The Shields curve for the most part lies between the two theoretical thresholds. {\textcopyright} ASCE.},

abstract = {In a turbulentwall shear flow, we explore, for the first time, the stochastic mechanics of loose boundary particle transport, having variable particle protrusions due to various cohesionless particle packing densities. The mean transport probabilities in contact and detachment modes are obtained. The mean transport probabilities in these modes as a function of Shields number (nondimensional fluid induced shear stress at the boundary) for different relative particle sizes (ratio of boundary roughness height to target particle diameter) and shear Reynolds numbers (ratio of fluid inertia to viscous damping) are presented. The transport probability in contact mode increases with an increase in Shields number attaining a peak and then decreases, while that in detachment mode increases monotonically. For the hydraulically transitional and rough flow regimes, the transport probability curves in contact mode for a given relative particle size of greater than or equal to unity attain their peaks corresponding to the averaged critical Shields numbers, from where the transport probability curves in detachment mode initiate. At an inception of particle transport, the mean probabilities in both the modes increase feebly with an increase in shear Reynolds number. Further, for a given particle size, the mean probability in contact mode increases with a decrease in critical Shields number attaining a critical value and then increases. However, the mean probability in detachment mode increases with a decrease in critical Shields number.},

abstract = {In this paper, the results of an experimental investigation of the turbulence intensity in gravel bed channels are described. The runs were carried out by measuring, with an acoustic Doppler velocimeter, the turbulence intensity profile along six verticals of a given cross section in a laboratory flume. The analysis of the measured intensity distributions has shown the existence of two different regions, above and below the tops of the roughness elements, in which different intensity profiles occur. Furthermore, the measured profiles have shown a maximum of the turbulence intensity that decreases for increasing values of the roughness height, confirming that the turbulence damping efficiency increases when the roughness elements protrude inside the flow. The applicability of Nezu's relationship (derived for a hydraulically smooth bed) for the experimental intensity profiles above the roughness elements is positively tested. Finally a new intensity distribution for a rough bed, applicable to the whole water depth, is proposed. In this profile, two coefficients having a known physical meaning (the maximum turbulence intensity and the depth at which this maximum is located) appear. {\textcopyright} ASCE.},

abstract = {We report an experimental investigation of the motion of bed load particles under steady and spatially uniform turbulent flow above a flat sediment bed of uniform grain size. Using a high-speed video imaging system, we recorded the trajectories of the moving particles and measured their velocity and the length and duration of their flights, as well as the surface density of the moving particles. Our observations show that entrained particles exhibit intermittent motion composed of the succession of periods of "flight" and periods of rest. During one flight, a particle may go through phases of reptation, during which it moves in nearly persistent contact with the rough bed, and phases of saltation, during which it travels sufficiently high above the bed to reach high velocities. The distributions of longitudinal and transverse particle velocities obey a decreasing exponential and a Gaussian law, respectively. Interestingly, these observations are similar to those previously reported for viscous flows. The experimental results presented here support the erosion-deposition model of Charru (2006) and allow the calibration of the involved coefficients. In particular, noting $\tau$*, the Shields number, and $\tau$*{\textless}inf{\textgreater}c{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, the threshold Shields number, we find that (1) the surface density of moving particles increases linearly with * - $\tau$*{\textless}inf{\textgreater}c{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}; (2) the average particle velocity increases linearly with $\tau$*{\textless}sup{\textgreater}1/2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} - $\tau$*{\textless}inf{\textgreater}c{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}1/2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, with a finite nonzero value at the threshold; (3) the flight duration scales with a characteristic settling time with no significant dependence on either * or the settling Reynolds number; and (4) the flight length increases linearly with $\tau$*{\textless}sup{\textgreater}1/2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} - $\tau$*{\textless}inf{\textgreater}c{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}1/2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}.

abstract = {[1] The concept of equal mobility of gravel transport is 2 decades old. The weak form of the hypothesis states that in order to transport the coarse half of the mean annual gravel load through a river reach at a rate equal to the fine half, the coarser material must be overrepresented on the bed surface, giving rise to a mobile-bed armor. The degree of mobile-bed armoring necessary to accomplish this diminishes with increasing bed shear stress. The strong form of the hypothesis states that the grain size distribution of the gravel portion of the bed load should be similar to that of the substrate and finer than that of the surface layer. Here the hypothesis is subjected to a rigorous test in the laboratory under controlled conditions which are nevertheless chosen to be as representative as possible of actual field conditions. The grain size distributions used in the experiment included both model "gravel" and model "sand." At the end of the experiment the entire surface layer and a significant depth of substrate were removed from an entire reach of the channel and sieved. The results of the experiment confirmed the weak form of equal mobility: The surface layer was significantly coarsened compared with the bed load, even when the "sand" was excluded from the size distributions. The strong form of equal mobility was also supported by the experiment, in that the size distribution of the "gravel" substrate was nearly identical to the size distribution of the "gravel" portion of the load. The gravel substrate was, however, slightly but measurably coarser than the gravel load, a tendency that has been observed in the field in cases for which the strong form is not satisfied.},

abstract = {This paper examines the importance of particle diffusion relative to advection in bedload transport. Particle diffusion is not included in existing approaches to bedload transport. Based on recent advances in the probabilistic theory of sediment transport, this paper emphasizes the part played by particle diffusion in bedload transport. The proposed model consists of the classic Saint-Venant–Exner equations supplemented by an advection–diffusion equation for particle activity (solid volume of particles in motion per unit streambed area). The model is solved numerically using standard finite-volume techniques. Our numerical simulations consider two case studies: (i) bed degradation under subcritical flow conditions and (ii) anti-dune development in supercritical flows on sloping gravel beds. These simulations show that particle diffusion plays a key role in bedload transport under non-uniform flow conditions. The diffusive sediment transport rate may be as large as the advective transport rate. When anti-dunes develop and migrate upstream, particle diffusion can create fluctuations in the sediment transport rate, whose amplitude compares with the capacity transport rate. Non-uniform flows can be characterized by a typical length, referred to as the adaptation length, which represents the distance that a particle dislodged from the bed travels before it reaches steady-state velocity. We show that the adaptation length is controlled by the particle advection velocity, particle diffusivity, and entrainment/deposition rates, but is independent of the bedform wavelength (contrary to common belief). For simulating bed degradation and anti-dune migration in gravel-bed rivers, a benchmark analysis of different bedload transport models provides evidence that those including particle diffusion perform better than classic models.},

We present a review of recent results from our previous works, which led to physical insights on these phenomena. These results were obtained from a systematic numerical study based on the accurate resolution - Direct Numerical Simulation via a pseudo-spectral approach - of the turbulent flow field, and on Lagrangian tracking of particles under different modelling assumptions. We underline the multiscale aspect of wall turbulence, which has challenged scientists to devise simple theoretical models adequate to fit experimental data, and we show that a sound rendering of wall turbulence mechanisms is required to produce a physical understanding of particle deposition and re-entrainment. This physical understanding can be implemented in more applied simulation techniques, such as Large-Eddy Simulation. Our arguments are based also on the phenomenology of coherent structures and on the examination of flow topology in connection with particle preferential distribution. Starting from these concepts, reasons why theoretical predictions may fail are examined together with the requirements which must be fulfilled by suitable predictive models. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {1 The relation between equilibrium stream channel morphology and three independent governing variables, discharge, sediment supply, and valley slope, is investigated using a stream table. The experiments are based on a generic physical model of a laterally active gravel bed stream and directed by a recently published rational regime model. While a variety of channel adjustments are possible, the primary adjustment observed was in the channel slope. Other adjustments, such as surface armor composition and cross-sectional shape, were minor in comparison. The equilibrium slope is well predicted by a linear function of sediment concentration which is bounded by two thresholds: one associated with the minimum stream power necessary to deform the bed and the other associated with the maximum sediment feed that can be transported by the available flow. The results suggest that the system tends to move toward the minimum slope capable of transporting the sediment supply, in the process increasing the flow resistance for the system. Whether or not a minimum slope or a maximum system-scale flow resistance is reached cannot be determined given the available data, but there appears to be a unique slope or, at least, a limited range of slopes) for which a stable alluvial channel morphology can be established for a given sediment concentration. The implications of this behavior are evaluated for the theoretical basis of the extremal hypothesis used to close the formulation of a rational regime model.},

In this limit, the simulated steady states of continuous transport can be described by simple analytical model equations relating the average transport layer properties to the law of the wall flow velocity profile. We use this model to calculate $\Theta$rt for arbitrary environments and derive a general Shields-like threshold diagram in which a Stokes-like number replaces the particle Reynolds number. Despite the simplicity of our hydrodynamic description, the predicted cessation threshold, both from the simulations and analytical model, quantitatively agrees with measurements for transport in air and viscous and turbulent liquids despite not being fitted to these measurements. We interpret the analytical model as a description of a continuous rebound motion of transported particles and thus $\Theta$rt as the minimal fluid shear stress needed to compensate the average energy loss of transported particles during an average rebound at the bed surface. This interpretation, supported by simulations near $\Theta$rt, implies that entrainment mechanisms are needed to sustain transport above $\Theta$rt. While entrainment by turbulent events sustains intermittent transport, entrainment by particle-bed impacts sustains continuous transport. Combining our interpretations with the critical energy criterion for incipient motion by Valyrakis and coworkers, we put forward a new conceptual picture of sediment transport intermittency.},

abstract = {A longstanding problem in the study of sediment transport in gravel-bed rivers is related to the physical mechanisms governing bed resistance and particle motion. To study this problem, we investigated the motion of coarse spherical glass beads entrained by a steady shallow turbulent water flow down a steep two-dimensional channel with a mobile bed. This experimental facility is the simplest representation of sediment transport on the laboratory scale, with the tremendous advantages that boundary conditions are perfectly controlled and a wealth of information can be obtained using imaging techniques. Flows were filmed from the side by a high-speed camera. Using image processing software made it possible to determine the flow characteristics such as particle trajectories, their state of motion (rest, rolling, or saltating motion), and flow depth. In accordance with earlier investigations, we observed that over short time periods, sediment transport appeared as a very intermittent process. To interpret these results, we revisited Einstein's theory on sediment and derived the statistical properties (probability distribution and autocorrelation function) of the key variables such as the solid discharge and the number of moving particles. Analyzing the autocorrelation functions and the probability distributions of our measurements revealed the existence of long-range correlations. For instance, whereas theory predicts a Binomial distribution for the number of moving particles, experiments demonstrated that a negative binomial distribution best fit our data, which emphasized the crucial role played by wide fluctuations. These frequent wide fluctuations stemmed particle entrainment and motion being collective phenomena rather than individual processes, contrary to what is assumed in most theoretical models. {\textcopyright} 2006 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {In soil-mantled steeplands, soil motions associated with creep, ravel, rain splash, soil slips, tree throw, and rodent activity are patchy and intermittent and involve widely varying travel distances. To describe the collective effect of these motions, we formulate a nonlocal expression for the soil flux. This probabilistic formulation involves upslope and downslope convolutions of land surface geometry to characterize motions in both directions, notably accommodating the bidirectional dispersal of material on gentle slopes as well as mostly downslope dispersal on steeper slopes, and it distinguishes between the mobilization of soil material and the effect of surface slope in giving a downslope bias to the dispersal of mobilized material. The formulation separates dispersal associated with intermittent surface motions from the slower bulk behavior associated with small-scale bioturbation and similar dilational processes operating mostly within the soil column. With a uniform rate of mobilization of soil material, the nearly parabolic form of a hillslope profile at steady state resembles a diffusive behavior. With a slope-dependent rate of mobilization, the steady state hillslope profile takes on a nonparabolic form where land surface elevation varies with downslope distance x as x(a) with a similar to 3/2, consistent with field observations and where the flux increases nonlinearly with increasing slope. The convolution description of the soil flux, when substituted into a suitable expression of conservation, yields a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation and can be mapped to discrete particle models of hillslope behavior and descriptions of soil-grain transport by rain splash as a stochastic advection-dispersion process.},

abstract = {Steep streams often feature a step-pool morphology where the steps determine channel stability and dissipate the stream's energy, and thus are important for local flow hydraulics and bedload transport. Steps also play a key-role for the coupling of channels and adjacent hillslopes by controlling hillslope stability. Although step-pool systems have been investigated in various modelling and experimental efforts, the processes of step formation and destruction remain under debate. Theories of step formation consider a wide range of dominant drivers and fall into three groups favouring hydraulic controls (HC), granular interactions during flow (GI) or random drivers (RD) as relevant factors for step location. A direct evaluation of these models with field observations is challenging, as step formation cannot be directly observed. Based on the physical mechanisms of the various formation models we derive diagnostic morphometric parameters and test them with a field data set from a steep stream in Switzerland. Our results suggest that one class of alluvial steps form due to jamming in narrow and narrowing sections of the channel, while steps in wide and widening sections form around rarely mobile keystones. These two models of step formation apply in our study reach at the same time in different locations of the channel. A third class of steps is forced by logs. Such steps are typically located close to the original growth position of the tree and therefore reflect strong channel-hillslope coupling. Wood-forced steps make up a minor fraction of the step population, but contribute significantly to the cumulative step height and are therefore relevant to reach-scale flow resistance of the channel. {\textcopyright} 2019 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {We report results from flume experiments designed to study the effect of width variations on the formation and stability of steps in steep streams. To physically model channel width changes we inserted multiple trapezoidal elements in the flume. Two competing effects are in play: a fluidic effect, suggesting that steps are more likely to form in wide areas because of deposition enhanced by lower shear stress, and a granular effect, suggesting that steps are more likely to form in narrow areas because of particle jamming. Our experiments show that width variations enhance the formation of steps. Although steps can form in every location, those in narrow/narrowing areas are more common, more stable and they occupy a larger portion of the channel width. These results stress the importance of particle interactions in coarse-bedded streams and help river engineers by providing a new element to consider when designing step-pool sequences in river restoration projects. {\textcopyright} 2020 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {We present a mesoscale erosion/deposition model, which differs from previous landscape evolution models equations by taking explicitly into account a mass balance equation for the streamflow. The geological and hydrological complexity is lumped into two basic fluxes (erosion and deposition) and two averaged parameters (unit width discharge q and stream slope s). The model couples the dynamics of streamflow and topography through, a sediment transport length function $\epsilon$(q), which is the average travel distance of a particle in the flow before being trapped on topography. This property reflects a time lag between erosion and deposition, which allows the streamflow not to be instantaneously at capacity. The so-called $\epsilon$-q model may reduce either to transport-limited or to detachment-limited erosion modes depending on $\epsilon$. But it also may not. We show in particular how it does or does not for steady state topographies, long-term evolution, and high-frequency base level perturbations. Apart from the unit width discharge and the settling velocity, the $\epsilon$(q) function depends on a dimensionless number encompassing the way sediment is transported within the streamflow. Using models of concentration profile through the water column, we show the dependency of this dimensionless coefficient on the Rouse number. We discuss how consistent the $\epsilon$-q model framework is with bed load scaling expressions and Einstein's conception of sediment motion. Copyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {This paper numerically investigates particle saltation in a turbulent channel flow having a rough bed consisting of two to three layers of densely packed spheres. The Shields function is 0.065 which is just above the sediment entrainment threshold to give a bed-load regime. The applied methodology is a combination of three technologies, i.e., the direct numerical simulation of turbulent flow; the combined finite-discrete element modeling of the deformation, movement, and collision of the particles; and the immersed boundary method for the fluid-solid interaction. It is shown that the presence of entrained particles significantly modifies the flow profiles of velocity, turbulent intensities, and shear stresses in the vicinity of a rough bed. The quasi-streamwise-aligned streaky structures are not observed in the near-wall region and the particles scatter on the rough bed owing to their large size. However, in the outer flow region, the turbulent coherent structures recover due to the weakening rough-bed effects and particle interferences. First- and second-order statistical features of particle translational and angular velocities, together with sediment concentration and volumetric flux density profiles, are presented. Several key parameters of the particle saltation trajectory are calculated and agree closely with published experimental data. Time histories of the hydrodynamic forces exerted upon a typical saltating particle, together with those of the particle's coordinates and velocities, are presented. A strong correlation is shown between the abruptly decreasing streamwise velocity and increasing vertical velocity at collision which indicates that the continuous saltation of large-grain-size particles is controlled by collision parameters such as particle incident angle, local bed packing arrangement, and particle density, etc. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Physical Society.},

The model is deterministic in the computation of particle trajectory, but probabilistic in terms of bed collision. This probabilistic element arises from the random structure of the bed. In the present analysis, a stochastic treatment of collision allows for a fairly complete model of saltation in water. Characteristic quantities, including the sediment transport rate itself, are derived and compared with experimental data. The model yields good agreement with data with a minimum of assumptions. The assumed three-dimensional random structure of the bed is a unique feature of the present model.

abstract = {This study uses a unique 10-year tracer dataset from a small gravel-bed stream to examine bed mobility and sediment dispersion over long timescales and at a range of spatial scales. Seasonal tracer data that captured multiple mobilizing events was examined, while the effects of morphology on bed mobility and sediment dispersion were captured at three spatial scales: within morphological units (unit scale), between morphological units (reach scale) and between reaches with different channel morphologies (channel scale). This was achieved by analyzing both reach-average mobility and travel distance data, as well as the development of ‘mobility maps' that capture the spatial variability in tracer mobility within the channel. The tracer data suggest that sediment transport in East Creek remains near critical the majority of the time, with only rare large events resulting in high mobility rates and grain travel distances large enough to move sediment past dominant bedforms. While a variable capturing both the magnitude and frequency of flow events within a season yielded a better predictor to sediment mobility and dispersion than peak discharge alone, the distribution of events of different magnitude within the season played a large role in determining tracer mobility rates and travel distances. The effects of morphology differed depending on the analysis scale, demonstrating the importance of scale, and therefore study design, when examining the effect of morphology on sediment transport.

The auditory and visual modes differ in the determination of particle neighbors, which at the level of groups results in higher polarization, lower cohesion, and larger cluster size for the auditory mode relative to the visual. With the increase in average density of the particles, these differences are more pronounced. These differences are due to the fact that these sense modalities robustly generate distinct spatial distributions of the particles. We demonstrate the use of a data-driven approach, called transfer entropy, to distinguish the sensing modalities by considering only a pair of particle trajectories. Such an approach could be applicable to real-world systems, where it may be a challenge to measure the position and velocity of every particle within a swarm.},

The vignettes varied in terms of whether the defendant spoke English or Spanish, and whether his mental illness symptoms were obvious or ambiguous. Overall, attorneys rated the Spanish-speaking defendant as less mentally ill than the English-speaking defendant, and were less likely to refer the Spanish-speaking defendant for a CST evaluation. Attorneys who perceived more logistical barriers to seeking a CST evaluation in their local communities were less likely to refer the defendant for a CST evaluation, but only when the defendant spoke Spanish. These findings suggest attorney decisions were influenced by language, although further research is needed to identify the mechanism of this influence.

abstract = {River bed-load transport is a kind of dense granular flow, and such flows are known to segregate grains. While gravel-river beds typically have an "armoured" layer of coarse grains on the surface, which acts to protect finer particles underneath from erosion, the contribution of granular physics to river-bed armouring has not yet been investigated. Here we examine these connections in a laboratory river with bimodal sediment size, by tracking the motion of particles from the surface to deep inside the bed, and find that armour develops by two distinct mechanisms. Bed-load transport in the near-surface layer drives rapid, shear rate-dependent advective segregation. Creeping grains beneath the bed-load layer give rise to slow but persistent diffusion-dominated segregation. We verify these findings with a continuum phenomenological model and discrete element method simulations. Our experiments suggest that some river-bed armouring may be due to granular segregation from below - rather than fluid-driven sorting from above - while also providing new insights on the mechanics of segregation that are relevant to a wide range of granular flows.},

The predicted threshold of entrainment of individual size fractions within a mixed‐size bed agrees well with observations as long as the pivoting angle is specified appropriately as a function of grain size. The rate and size distribution of bed load transport generally agrees well with natural data as long as effective bed shear stress in the presence of bed forms can be defined, bed load transport measurements are reliable, and the size distribution of available sediment is accurately specified.

abstract = {Equilibrium is defined as a single‐valued, temporally invariant functional relationship between the values of an output variable and the values of the input variable(s) in a geomorphic system. Disequilibrium occurs if the output deviates from the functional relationship by more than a consensual degree. Natural geomorphic variables are characterized by a relaxation time. Output variables are insensitive to cyclical inputs with frequencies much greater than the relaxation time, but can respond completely for sufficiently low frequencies. Rapid trends, recent step changes or pulse inputs, and intermediate frequency inputs can cause disequilibrium. The gradient of sand‐bed alluvial channels (the output variable) is determined by sediment and water delivery from slopes (the input variables), and changes in this hydraulic regime require regrading by erosion and deposition. Initial stages of adjustment to changed regime in a long, unbranched channel with sediment and water delivery only at the upstream end propagate downstream, but later stages of adjustment occur simultaneously throughout the reach. In a dendritic channel network the gradient responds rather uniformly throughout the network to changes in regime during all stages of adjustment. The time scale of adjustment to changed regime depends upon the size of the channel network (or stream length), the sediment and water discharges, and to a lesser degree upon the magnitude of the change. Grade as defined by Mackin (1948) is synonymous with equilibrium as used in this paper if ‘a period of years' is replaced by ‘a time period commensurate with the relaxation time of the gradient'. The use of the term grade is best restricted to a single‐valued relationship between channel gradient and the hydraulic regime. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1982 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd},

Unfortunately, non-Gaussianity is weak (i.e., no intermittency) and vorticity gets preferentially aligned with the wrong eigenvector of the deformation. We then show that slightly modifying the former vectorial field in order to impose the long-range-correlated nature of turbulence allows to reproduce the main properties of stationary flows. Doing so, we end up with a realistic incompressible, skewed and intermittent velocity field that reproduces the main characteristics of 3D turbulence in the inertial range, including correct vorticity alignment properties. {\textcopyright} 2010 Europhysics Letters Association.},

Field measurements of bedload transport are notoriously difficult, which precludes understanding many of the processes and mechanics associated with grain motion. Such uncertainties are exacerbated when using bedload transport equations, most of which were derived using data from a single river or set of laboratory flume experiments. Recently, laboratory experiments have focused on better quantifying the processes that impact bedload fluxes, which can then be used to improve sediment transport predictions. We highlight recent advances in laboratory instrumentation that can be used in bedload transport studies. In particular, more accurate ways to measure bedload fluxes, near-bed turbulence, bed grain sizes, and topography hold great promise. Laboratory experiments have also fundamentally improved our understanding of the influence of sediment supply and armoring processes on bedload fluxes and channel conditions. The importance of flow hydrographs in controlling total bedload transport rates and bedload hysteresis has also been demonstrated using flume experiments. Finally, many details about the mechanics of grain motion including flow turbulence, bed arrangement, and particle transport statistics are only possible through laboratory investigations, and we feature key knowledge gaps that can be improved with further study.},

In this study, we incorporate sediment transport equations derived from fieldwork into a computer model that predicts the delivery of sediment from hillslopes in a steep Mediterranean landscape near Santa Barbara, California. The sediment transport equations are driven by rainstorms and fires that are stochastically generated from probability distributions. The model is used to compare the rates and processes of sediment delivery under two vegetation types: coastal sage scrub and grasslands. Conversion of vegetation from sage to exotic grasses is a common land management strategy in the region and may also be engendered by regional climate change due to global warming. Results from the model suggest that (1) approximately 40{\%} more sediment is delivered from grasslands (98 t km-2 yr-1) than the sage scrub (71 t km-2 yr-1) and (2) chronic soil creep processes dominate under grasslands whereas catastrophic processes dominate under coastal sage scrub. Results from the model also suggest that changes in the spatial distribution of vegetation arising from climate change will have a greater effect on sediment delivery than changes in the magnitude and frequency of meteorological events.},

abstract = {The pioneering predictor of fluvial bed-load transport rate proposed by Meyer-Peter and M{\"{u}}ller in 1948 is still extensively used in basic research and engineering applications. A review of the basis for its formulation reveals, however, that an unnecessary bed roughness correction was applied to cases of plane-bed morphodynamic equilibrium. Its inclusion followed a flow resistance parameterization in terms of the Nikuradse roughness height, which has been shown (well after the publication of their work) to be inappropriate for the characterization of mobile bed rough conditions in rivers. Removing the unnecessary correction and incorporating an improved correction of the boundary shear stress due to sidewall effects allow elucidation of the most parsimonious form of the bed-load relation of Meyer-Peter and M{\"{u}}ller that is dictated by their own data set. The new predictor is presented in terms of two alternative power law forms. These amended forms show that, in the case of lower-regime plane-bed equilibrium transport of uniform bed sediment, the new estimates of volume bed-load transport rates are less than or equal to half the values that would be obtained with the original relation of Meyer-Peter and M{\"{u}}ller in the absence of the unnecessary bed roughness correction. The meticulous database and clear analysis of the original work of Meyer-Peter and M{\"{u}}ller greatly aided the present writers in their reanalysis, which liberally uses the hindsight offered by 58 years of subsequent research. {\textcopyright} 2006 ASCE.},

abstract = {With the growth of available computational resource, CFD-DEM (computational fluid dynamics-discrete element method) becomes an increasingly promising and feasible approach for the study of sediment transport. Several existing CFD-DEM solvers are applied in chemical engineering and mining industry. However, a robust CFD-DEM solver for the simulation of sediment transport is still desirable. In this work, the development of a three-dimensional, massively parallel, and open-source CFD-DEM solver SediFoam is detailed. This solver is built based on open-source solvers OpenFOAM and LAMMPS. OpenFOAM is a CFD toolbox that can perform three-dimensional fluid flow simulations on unstructured meshes; LAMMPS is a massively parallel DEM solver for molecular dynamics. Several validation tests of SediFoam are performed using cases of a wide range of complexities. The results obtained in the present simulations are consistent with those in the literature, which demonstrates the capability of SediFoam for sediment transport applications. In addition to the validation test, the parallel efficiency of SediFoam is studied to test the performance of the code for large-scale and complex simulations. The parallel efficiency tests show that the scalability of SediFoam is satisfactory in the simulations using up to O(107) particles.},

abstract = {AIM To investigate the retention on anti-TNF agents used in a real-world setting, and determine the factors predicting retention on drug. METHOD Patients starting anti-TNF therapy were recorded prospectively on the departmental database. Medical records of all patients commenced on anti-TNF therapy between 2006 and 2013 at the Rheumatology Department, Waikato Hospital, Hamilton, were retrospectively reviewed to obtain details of their course on biologic therapy. RESULTS 183 patients were identified. 139 (76.5{\%}) were commenced on adalimumab. The predominant indication was rheumatoid arthritis (52.5{\%}). 60 patients (32.8{\%}) discontinued their initial anti-TNF agent. Of these, 31.7{\%} were due to primary failure, 36.7{\%} due to secondary failure and 25{\%} due to adverse events. At 5 years, retention on agents was: adalimumab (77.2{\%}), etanercept (69.6{\%}) and infliximab (16.7{\%}). Retention on adalimumab was significantly higher than infliximab (p{\textless}0.001), but did not differ between adalimumab and etanercept, or etanercept and infliximab. CONCLUSION In a real-world setting, retention on infliximab was significantly lower than adalimumab.},

abstract = {Freshwater biodiversity is the over-riding conservation priority during the International Decade for Action - 'Water for Life' - 2005 to 2015. Fresh water makes up only 0.01{\%} of the World's water and approximately 0.8{\%} of the Earth's surface, yet this tiny fraction of global water supports at least 100000 species out of approximately 1.8 million - almost 6{\%} of all described species. Inland waters and freshwater biodiversity constitute a valuable natural resource, in economic, cultural, aesthetic, scientific and educational terms. Their conservation and management are critical to the interests of all humans, nations and governments. Yet this precious heritage is in crisis. Fresh waters are experiencing declines in biodiversity far greater than those in the most affected terrestrial ecosystems, and if trends in human demands for water remain unaltered and species losses continue at current rates, the opportunity to conserve much of the remaining biodiversity in fresh water will vanish before the 'Water for Life' decade ends in 2015. Why is this so, and what is being done about it? This article explores the special features of freshwater habitats and the biodiversity they support that makes them especially vulnerable to human activities. We document threats to global freshwater biodiversity under five headings: overexploitation; water pollution; flow modification; destruction or degradation of habitat; and invasion by exotic species. Their combined and interacting influences have resulted in population declines and range reduction of freshwater biodiversity worldwide. Conservation of biodiversity is complicated by the landscape position of rivers and wetlands as 'receivers' of land-use effluents, and the problems posed by endemism and thus non-substitutability. In addition, in many parts of the world, fresh water is subject to severe competition among multiple human stakeholders. Protection of freshwater biodiversity is perhaps the ultimate conservation challenge because it is influenced by the upstream drainage network, the surrounding land, the riparian zone, and - in the case of migrating aquatic fauna - downstream reaches. Such prerequisites are hardly ever met. Immediate action is needed where opportunities exist to set aside intact lake and river ecosystems within large protected areas. For most of the global land surface, trade-offs between conservation of freshwater biodiversity and human use of ecosystem goods and services are necessary. We advocate continuing attempts to check species loss but, in many situations, urge adoption of a compromise position of management for biodiversity conservation, ecosystem functioning and resilience, and human livelihoods in order to provide a viable long-term basis for freshwater conservation. Recognition of this need will require adoption of a new paradigm for biodiversity protection and freshwater ecosystem management - one that has been appropriately termed 'reconciliation ecology'. {\textcopyright} 2005 Cambridge Philosophical Society.},

abstract = {Double-averaged turbulence characteristics in a uniform flow over a gravel bed are studied. The log-law for the velocity is preserved above the interfacial sublayer, while the velocity within that sublayer follows a polynomial law. The Reynolds shear stress distribution within the roughness sublayer has a considerable damping. A quadrant analysis suggests that the sweeps become the prevalent mechanism within the interfacial sublayer. Within the interfacial sublayer, the quadrant plots of the form-induced velocities form a tilted pseudo-elliptical shape, suggesting that the fluid undergoes a cyclic process of upward-streamwise deceleration and downward-streamwise acceleration. An upward-downstream flux of the turbulent kinetic energy is prevalent over the entire flow depth, while a downward-upstream flux corresponding to sweep events is the mechanism within the interfacial sublayer. The energy budget indicates that the turbulent production, dissipation and diffusion, having attained their peaks, reduce sharply within the interfacial sublayer, and the pressure energy diffusion changes drastically to a negative magnitude below the virtual bed level. {\textcopyright} 2010 International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research.},

Advances like SPPnet [1] and Fast R-CNN [2] have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region proposal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their convolutional features - using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with 'attention' mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified network where to look. For the very deep VGG-16 model [3], our detection system has a frame rate of 5 fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO datasets with only 300 proposals per image.

abstract = {In 1989, Sir Sam Edwards made the visionary proposition to treat jammed granular materials using a volume ensemble of equiprobable jammed states in analogy to thermal equilibrium statistical mechanics, despite their inherent athermal features. Since then, the statistical mechanics approach for jammed matter - one of the very few generalizations of Gibbs-Boltzmann statistical mechanics to out-of-equilibrium matter - has garnered an extraordinary amount of attention by both theorists and experimentalists. Its importance stems from the fact that jammed states of matter are ubiquitous in nature appearing in a broad range of granular and soft materials such as colloids, emulsions, glasses, and biomatter. Indeed, despite being one of the simplest states of matter - primarily governed by the steric interactions between the constitutive particles - a theoretical understanding based on first principles has proved exceedingly challenging. Here a systematic approach to jammed matter based on the Edwards statistical mechanical ensemble is reviewed. The construction of microcanonical and canonical ensembles based on the volume function, which replaces the Hamiltonian in jammed systems, is discussed. The importance of approximation schemes at various levels is emphasized leading to quantitative predictions for ensemble averaged quantities such as packing fractions and contact force distributions. An overview of the phenomenology of jammed states and experiments, simulations, and theoretical models scrutinizing the strong assumptions underlying Edwards approach is given including recent results suggesting the validity of Edwards ergodic hypothesis for jammed states. A theoretical framework for packings whose constitutive particles range from spherical to nonspherical shapes such as dimers, polymers, ellipsoids, spherocylinders or tetrahedra, hard and soft, frictional, frictionless and adhesive, monodisperse, and polydisperse particles in any dimensions is discussed providing insight into a unifying phase diagram for all jammed matter. Furthermore, the connection between the Edwards ensemble of metastable jammed states and metastability in spin glasses is established. This highlights the fact that the packing problem can be understood as a constraint satisfaction problem for excluded volume and force and torque balance leading to a unifying framework between the Edwards ensemble of equiprobable jammed states and out-of-equilibrium spin glasses.},

abstract = {The determination of the probability distribution function (PDF) of uncertain input and model parameters in engineering application codes is an issue of importance for uncertainty quantification methods. One of the approaches that can be used for the PDF determination of input and model parameters is the application of methods based on the maximum entropy principle (MEP) and the maximum relative entropy (MREP). These methods determine the PDF that maximizes the information entropy when only partial information about the parameter distribution is known, such as some moments of the distribution and its support. In addition, this paper shows the application of the MREP to update the PDF when the parameter must fulfill some technical specifications (TS) imposed by the regulations. Three computer programs have been developed: GEDIPA, which provides the parameter PDF using empirical distribution function (EDF) methods; UNTHERCO, which performs the Monte Carlo sampling on the parameter distribution; and DCP, which updates the PDF considering the TS and the MREP. Finally, the paper displays several applications and examples for the determination of the PDF applying the MEP and the MREP, and the influence of several factors on the PDF},

The barrier-switching process is constructed as a semi-Markov alternating process: the times at which a change of the barrier state can occcur form a general renewal process and the probability of leaving a state depends on the time the barrier resides in the state before the jump. During the interjump interval, the barrier is fixed in one of the two states and the crossing dynamics is described by a general (not necessarily exponential) decay law. We give the general formulae describing the averaged escape dynamics, where the averaging runs over all possible histories of the switching process. Using the above device of the selective residence times, the recently discussed phenomenon of resonant activation (a minimal averaged lifetime of the particle in the potential well) emerges also within the framework of the conventional exponential escape dynamics.},

abstract = {Bed load transport in Muddy Creek, Wyoming, a sand‐bedded meandering river with equilibrium bottom topography, was found to consist of a zone of maximum sediment flux that shifted across the channel from near the inside bank in the upstream part of the bend toward the pool at the minimum radius of curvature. Significant net cross‐stream transport continued even through the crossings between the bends. The downstream bed load transport field for the bend which was studied in greatest detail was the same as that computed from bed form migration measurements and can be predicted from appropriate boundary shear stress data and the Yalin bed load equation. The zone of maximum bed load transport followed an outward‐shifting region of maximum boundary shear stress, although in the downstream end of the bend the sediment transport maximum tended to stay closer to the centerline than the boundary shear stress maximum due to particle size influences. Net cross‐stream transport varied with particle size and was effected by three major processes: topographically‐induced, near‐bed, cross‐stream flow; trough wise flow along obliquely oriented bed forms; and rolling or avalanching of particles on bed form lee faces plus rolling or mass sliding on a steep cross‐stream point bar side slope. Coarse particles were carried outward over the top of the point bar by a near‐bed cross‐stream flow that was induced by downstream shoaling. These particles then rolled and slid on the point bar side slope and eventually were carried toward the outer bank by troughwise transport along oblique dunes. In the upstream part of the bend, fine particles were carried inward by the channel curvature‐induced, near‐bed flow and by troughwise transport along lee faces of oblique bed forms. Fine particles and coarse particles crossed paths on top of the point bar, where weak troughwise flow moved just the finer particles toward the convex bank, and on the point bar face, where coarse particles rolled against the secondary circu‐ lation that was carrying the finer particles. Net cross‐stream bed load transport was toward the pool and was on average about 10{\%} of the downstream bed load transport. The Engelund equation predicts reasonably well the general pattern of net cross‐stream transport through the meander, but it does not account for the substantial troughwise transport caused by oblique bedforms at several locations in the bend. Our observations suggest that equilibrium bed topography occurs when there is net outward transport into the outward shifting zone of maximum boundary shear stress.

abstract = {A numerical model for a loose packing process of spherical particles is presented. The simulation model starts with randomly choosing a sphere according to a pregenerated continuous particle-size distribution, and then dropping the sphere into a dimension-specified box, and obtaining its final position by using dropping and rolling rules which are derived from a similar physical process of spheres dropping in the gravitational field to minimize its gravity potential. Effects of three different particle-size distributions on the packing structure were investigated. Analysis on the physical background of the powder-based manufacturing process is additionally applied to produce optimal packing parameters of bimodal and Gaussian distributions to improve the quality of the fabricated parts. The results showed that higher packing density can be obtained using bimodal size distribution with a particle-size ratio from 1.5 to 2.0 and the mixture composition around n 2:n 1=6:4. For particle size with a Gaussian distribution, the particle radii should be limited in a narrow range around 0.67 to 1.5. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {In this paper, the entrainment and movement of coarse particles on the bed of an open channel is numerically investigated. Rather than model the sediment transport using a concentration concept, this study treats the sediment as individual particles and investigates the interaction between turbulent coherent structures and particle entrainment. The applied methodology is a combination of the direct numerical simulation of turbulent flow, the combined finite-discrete element modeling of particle motion and collision, and the immersed boundary method for the fluid-solid interaction. In this study, flow over a water-worked rough-bed consisting of 2-3 layers of densely packed spheres is adopted and the Shields function is 0.065 which is just above the entrainment threshold to give a bed-load regime. Numerical results for turbulent flow, sediment entrainment statistics, hydrodynamic forces acting on the particles, and the interaction between turbulence coherent structures and particle entrainment are presented. It is shown that the presence of entrained particles significantly modifies the mean velocity and turbulence quantity profiles in the vicinity of a rough-bed and that the instantaneous lift force can be larger than a particle's submerged weight in a narrow region above the effective bed location, although the mean lift force is always smaller than the submerged weight. This, from a hydrodynamic point of view, presents strong evidence for a close cause-and-effect relationship between coherent structures and sediment entrainment. Furthermore, instantaneous numerical results on particle entrainment and the surrounding turbulent flow are reported which show a strong correlation between sediment entrainment and sweep events and the underlying mechanisms are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract = {A 3D Lagrangian model of the saltation of solid spherical particles on the bed of an open channel flow, accounting for turbulence-induced mechanisms, is proposed and employed as the key tool of the study. The differences between conventional 2D models and a proposed 3D saltation model are discussed and the advantages of the 3D model are highlighted. Particularly, the 3D model includes a special procedure allowing generation of 3D flow velocity fields. This procedure is based on the assumption that the spectra of streamwise, vertical and transverse velocity components are known at any distance from the bed. The 3D model was used to identify and quantify effects of turbulence on particle entrainment and saltation. The analysis of particle trajectories focused on their diffusive nature, clarifying: (i) the effect of particle mobility parameter; (ii) the effect of bed topography; and (iii) the effect of turbulence. Specifically, the results of numerical simulations describing the abovementioned effects on the change in time of the variance are presented. In addition, the change in time of the skewness and kurtosis, which are likely to reflect the turbulence influence on the spread of particles, are also shown. Two different diffusion regimes (local and intermediate) for each of the investigated flow conditions are confidently identified. {\textcopyright} 2012 {\textcopyright} Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Wien.},

abstract = {Direct consequences of the human role, where human activity affects river channels through engineering works including channelization, dam construction, diversion and culverting, have been long recognised [Marsh, G.P., 1864. Man and Nature or Physical Geography as Modified by Human Action. Charles Scribner, New York; Thomas Jr., W.L., (ed.) 1956. Man's Role in Changing the Face of the Earth. Chicago, University of Chicago Press, Chicago.]. The less obvious indirect effects of point and reach changes occurring downstream and throughout the basin, however, are much more recently appreciated, dating from key contributions by Strahler [Strahler, A.N., 1956. The nature of induced erosion and aggradation. In W. L. Thomas (Ed.), Man's Role in Changing the Face of the Earth. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 621-638.], Wolman [Wolman, M.G., 1967. A cycle of sedimentation and erosion in urban river channels. Geografiska Annaler 49A, 385-95.], Schumm [Schumm, S.A., 1969. River metamorphosis. Proceedings American Society of Civil Engineers, Journal Hydraulics Division 95, 255-73.], and Graf [Graf, W.L., 1977. The rate law in fluvial geomorphology. American Journal of Science, 277, 178-191.]. These are complemented by effects of alterations of land use, such as deforestation, intensive agriculture and incidence of fire, with the most extreme effects produced by building activity and urbanisation. Changing river channels are most evident in the channel cross-section where changes of size, shape and composition are now well-established, with up to tenfold increases or decreases illustrated by results from more than 200 world studies. In addition the overall channel planform, the network and the ecology have changed. Specific terms have become associated with changing river channels including enlargement, shrinkage and metamorphosis. Although the scope of adjustment has been established, it has not always been possible to predict what will happen in a particular location, because of complex response and contingency. The ways in which changes in cross-section relate to reach and network changes are less clear, despite investigations showing the distribution of changes along segmented channels. When considering the human role in relation to changing river channels, at least five challenges persist. First, because prediction of the nature and amount of likely change at a particular location is not certain, and because the contrasting responses of humid and arid systems needs to be considered, modelling is required to reduce uncertainty, as was first emphasised by Burkham [Burkham, D.E., 1981. Uncertainties resulting from changes in river form. American Society Civil Engineers Proceedings, Journal Hydraulics Division 107, 593-610.]. Second, feedback effects incorporated within the relationship between changes at channel, reach and network scales can have considerable implications, especially because changes now evident may have occurred, or have been initiated, under different environmental conditions. Third, consideration of global climate change is imperative when considering channel sensitivity and responses to threshold conditions. Fourth, channel design involving geomorphology should now be an integral part of restoration procedures. This requires, fifthly, greater awareness of different cultures as a basis for understanding constraints imposed by legislative frameworks. Better understanding of the ways in which the perception of the human role in changing river channels varies with culture as well as varying over time should enhance application of design for river channel landscapes. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The ability to automatically detect certain types of cells or cellular subunits in microscopy images is of significant interest to a wide range of biomedical research and clinical practices. Cell detection methods have evolved from employing hand-crafted features to deep learning-based techniques. The essential idea of these methods is that their cell classifiers or detectors are trained in the pixel space, where the locations of target cells are labeled. In this paper, we seek a different route and propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based cell detection method that uses encoding of the output pixel space. For the cell detection problem, the output space is the sparsely labeled pixel locations indicating cell centers. We employ random projections to encode the output space to a compressed vector of fixed dimension. Then, CNN regresses this compressed vector from the input pixels. Furthermore, it is possible to stably recover sparse cell locations on the output pixel space from the predicted compressed vector using {\$}L{\_}1{\$}-norm optimization. In the past, output space encoding using compressed sensing (CS) has been used in conjunction with linear and non-linear predictors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful use of CNN with CS-based output space encoding. We made substantial experiments on several benchmark datasets, where the proposed CNN + CS framework (referred to as CNNCS) achieved the highest or at least top-3 performance in terms of F1-score, compared with other state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {In 1958, Ralph E. Gomory transformed the field of integer programming when he published a short paper that described his cutting-plane algorithm for pure integer programs and announced that the method could be refined to give a finite algorithm for integer programming. In January of 2008, to commemorate the anniversary of Gomory's seminal paper, a special session celebrating fifty years of integer programming was held in Aussois, France, as part of the 12th Combinatorial Optimization Workshop. This book is based on the material presented during this session. 50 Years of Integer Programming offers an account of featured talks at the 2008 Aussois workshop, namely - Michele Conforti, G{\'{e}}rard Cornu{\'{e}}jols, and Giacomo Zambelli: Polyhedral Approaches to Mixed Integer Linear Programming - William Cook: 50+ Years of Combinatorial Integer Programming - Francois Vanderbeck and Laurence A. Wolsey: Reformulation and Decomposition of Integer Programs The book contains reprints of key historical articles together with new troductions and historical perspectives by the authors: Egon Balas, Michel Balinski, Jack Edmonds, Ralph E. Gomory, Arthur M. Geoffrion, Alan J. Hoffman {\&} Joseph B. Kruskal, Richard M. Karp, Harold W. Kuhn, and Ailsa H. Land {\&} Alison G. Doig. It also contains written versions of survey lectures on six of the hottest topics in the field by distinguished members of the integer programming community: - Friedrich Eisenbrand: Integer Programming and Algorithmic Geometry of Numbers - Raymond Hemmecke, Matthias K{\"{o}}ppe, Jon Lee, and Robert Weismantel: Nonlinear Integer Programming - Andrea Lodi: Mixed Integer Programming Computation - Francois Margot: Symmetry in Integer Linear Programming - Franz Rendl: Semidefinite Relaxations for Integer Programming - Jean-Philippe P. Richard and Santanu S. Dey: The Group-Theoretic Approach to Mixed Integer Programming Integer programming holds great promise for the future, and continues to build on its foundations. Indeed, Gomory's finite cutting-plane method for the pure integer case is currently being reexamined and is showing new promise as a practical computational method. This book is a uniquely useful celebration of the past, present and future of this important and active field. Ideal for students and researchers in mathematics, computer science and operations research, it exposes mathematical optimization, in particular integer programming and combinatorial optimization, to a broad audience. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.

Cells are continually shed from its surface and replaced by division of the basal cells, which has a mean generation time estimated to be about 4 days1. Because of the papillae in the skin, the relation between the area of the basal cell layer and the surface is about 20 : 1. Because it must be refractive, there can be no papillae on the cornea, and the relation between the basal cell layer and the surface is accordingly 1 : 1. This should correspond to higher demands on the generative capacity of the corneal basal cells compared with skin. The epidermal basal cells are in close contact with a well developed capillary network. There are no vessels in the cornea, and so it can be assumed that the supply of its epithelium is poorer. Corneal epithelium, nonetheless, has considerable healing capacity, which is achieved primarily by migration of epithelial cells. {\textcopyright} 1971 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Temporary storage of sediment within alluvial valley floors modulates the long-term transport of sediment through landscapes. The fate of weathering minerals or sediment-bound constituents in fluvial environments depends on the relative time scales of constituent degradation and particle residence time within valleys. Particles follow a set of trajectories through valley floors: some particles pass directly through the channel, reaching the basin outlet rapidly after being introduced to the fluvial system; others remain for long periods in deposits such as flood plains. Traditional sediment routing theory, based on the principle of sediment mass conservation along reaches of channel, does not account for exchanges of sediment with temporary sediment storage reservoirs outside the channel, such as flood plains, deltas, and alluvial fans. This article formalizes a theory that incorporates the role of such exchanges in the migration of sediment through river systems, by computing the probabilistic structure of particle trajectories through alluvial valley floors. Equations are developed for computing these trajectories from the sediment budget of a valley floor in steady state. Mathematical strategies for using such relationships to model transient storage conditions are proposed, and other potential model enhancements are discussed. The approach is illustrated using a hypothetical valley floor as an example. The theory can be used to examine rates of sediment overturn in valleys, map particle residence times, and account for the redistribution and decomposition of weathering minerals and particle-bound constituents. The theory has numerous potential management applications, some of which are discussed herein. The hypothetical example demonstrates that the probability distribution of particle residence times in the valleys of most alluvial rivers should be strongly right skewed.},

@article{Lee2018,
abstract = {Fluvial bed-load transport is notoriously unpredictable, especially near the threshold of motion where stochastic fluctuations in sediment flux are large. Laboratory and field observations suggest that particles are entrained collectively, but this behavior is not well resolved. Collective entrainment introduces new length scales and timescales of correlation into probabilistic formulations of bed-load flux. We perform a series of experiments to directly quantify spatially clustered movement of particles (i.e., collective motion), using a steep-slope 2-D flume in which centimeter-scale marbles are fed at varying rates into a shallow and turbulent water flow. We observe that entrainment results exclusively from particle collisions and is generally collective, while particles deposit independently of each other. The size distribution of collective motion events is roughly exponential and constant across sediment feed rates. The primary effect of changing feed rate is simply to change the entrainment frequency, although the relation between these two diverges from the expected linear form in the slowly driven limit. The total displacement of all particles entrained in a collision event is proportional to the kinetic energy deposited in the bed by the impactor. The first-order picture that emerges is similar to generic avalanching dynamics in sandpiles: "avalanches" (collective entrainment events) of a characteristic size relax with a characteristic timescale regardless of feed rate, but the frequency of avalanches increases in proportion to the feed rate. The transition from intermittent to continuous bed-load transport then results from the progressive merger of entrainment avalanches with increasing transport rate. As most bed-load transport occurs in the intermittent regime, the length scale of collective entrainment should be considered a fundamental addition to any probabilistic bed-load framework.},

Competitive interactions are considered in a global case, in which birth and death rates are influenced by all individuals in the system, and in a nonlocal but finite-range case in which interaction affects individuals in a neighborhood (we also address the noninteracting case). In the global case one single or few-cluster configurations are achieved with the spatial distribution of the bugs tied to the type of diffusion. In the L{\'{e}}vy case long tails appear for some properties characterizing the shape and dynamics of clusters. Under nonlocal finite-range interactions periodic patterns appear with periodicity set by the interaction range. This length acts as a cutoff limiting the influence of the long L{\'{e}}vy jumps, so that spatial configurations under the two types of diffusion become more similar. By dividing initially everyone into different families and following their descent it is possible to show that mixing of families and their competition is greatly influenced by the spatial dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},

Classically, aggregation has been viewed as an evolutionarily advantageous state, in which members derive the benefits of protection, mate choice, and centralized information, balanced by the costs of limiting resources. Consisting of individual members, aggregations nevertheless function as an integrated whole, displaying a complex set of behaviors not possible at the level of the individual organism. Complexity theory indicates that large populations of units can self-organize into aggregations that generate pattern, store information, and engage in collective decision- making. This begs the question, are all emergent properties of animal aggregations functional or are some simply pattern? Solutions to this dilemma will necessitate a closer marriage of theoretical and modeling studies linked to empirical work addressing the choices, and trajectories, of individuals constrained by membership in the group.},

In the all-to-all setup, we find that the non-linear interactions induce bona fide phase transitions that, contrary to the linear version of the model, survive in the thermodynamic limit. The main effect of the complex network is to shift the transition lines and modify the finite-size dependence, a modification that can be captured with the introduction of an effective system size that decreases with the degree heterogeneity of the network. While a non-trivial finite-size dependence of the moments of the probability distribution is derived from our treatment, mean-field exponents are nevertheless obtained in the thermodynamic limit.

abstract = {The emergence of collective motion exhibited by systems ranging from flocks of animals to self-propelled microorganisms to the cytoskeleton is a ubiquitous and fascinating self-organization phenomenon1-12. Similarities between these systems, such as the inherent polarity of the constituents, a density-dependent transition to ordered phases or the existence of very large density fluctuations13-16, suggest universal principles underlying pattern formation. This idea is followed by theoretical models at all levels of description: micro-or mesoscopic models directly map local forces and interactions using only a few, preferably simple, interaction rules 12,17-21, and more macroscopic approaches in the hydrodynamic limit rely on the systems' generic symmetries8,22,23. All these models characteristically have a broad parameter space with a manifold of possible patterns, most of which have not yet been experimentally verified. The complexity of interactions and the limited parameter control of existing experimental systems are major obstacles to our understanding of the underlying ordering principles13. Here we demonstrate the emergence of collective motion in a high-density motility assay that consists of highly concentrated actin filaments propelled by immobilized molecular motors in a planar geometry. Above a critical density, the filaments self-organize to form coherently moving structures with persistent density modulations, such as clusters, swirls and interconnected bands. These polar nematic structures are long lived and can span length scales orders of magnitudes larger than their constituents. Our experimental approach, which offers control of all relevant system parameters, complemented by agent-$\beta$ased simulations, allows backtracking of the assembly and disassembly pathways to the underlying local interactions. We identify weak and local alignment interactions to be essential for the observed formation of patterns and their dynamics. The presented minimal polar-pattern-forming system may thus provide new insight into emerging order in the broad class of active fluids8,23,24 and selfpropelled particles17,25. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In this first-order phase transition, the magnetization is proportional to the liquid fraction and thus varies continuously throughout the phase diagram.

@article{Toner1998,
abstract = {We present a quantitative continuum theory of “flocking”: the collective coherent motion of large numbers of self-propelled organisms. In agreement with everyday experience, our model predicts the existence of an “ordered phase” of flocks, in which all members of even an arbitrarily large flock move together with the same mean velocity [formula presented] This coherent motion of the flock is an example of spontaneously broken symmetry: no preferred direction for the motion is picked out a priori in the model; rather, each flock is allowed to, and does, spontaneously pick out some completely arbitrary direction to move in. By analyzing our model we can make detailed, quantitative predictions for the long-distance, long-time behavior of this “broken symmetry state.” The “Goldstone modes” associated with this “spontaneously broken rotational symmetry” are fluctuations in the direction of motion of a large part of the flock away from the mean direction of motion of the flock as a whole. These “Goldstone modes” mix with modes associated with conservation of bird number to produce propagating sound modes. These sound modes lead to enormous fluctuations of the density of the flock, far larger, at long wavelengths, than those in, e.g., an equilibrium gas. Our model is similar in many ways to the Navier-Stokes equations for a simple compressible fluid; in other ways, it resembles a relaxational time-dependent Ginsburg-Landau theory for an [formula presented] component isotropic ferromagnet. In spatial dimensions [formula presented] the long-distance behavior is correctly described by a linearized theory, and is equivalent to that of an unusual but nonetheless equilibrium model for spin systems. For [formula presented] nonlinear fluctuation effects radically alter the long distance behavior, making it different from that of any known equilibrium model. In particular, we find that in [formula presented] where we can calculate the scaling exponents exactly, flocks exhibit a true, long-range ordered, spontaneously broken symmetry state, in contrast to equilibrium systems, which cannot spontaneously break a continuous symmetry in [formula presented] (the “Mermin-Wagner” theorem). We make detailed predictions for various correlation functions that could be measured either in simulations, or by quantitative imaging of real flocks. We also consider an anisotropic model, in which the birds move preferentially in an “easy” (e.g., horizontal) plane, and make analogous, but quantitatively different, predictions for that model as well. For this anisotropic model, we obtain exact scaling exponents for all spatial dimensions, including the physically relevant case [formula presented] {\textcopyright} 1998 The American Physical Society.},

The former is an essential ingredient of most systems in population dynamics and involves extinction at low densities, growth at higher densities, and saturation at still higher densities. The latter feature is also highly relevant, particularly to biological systems, and goes beyond the unrealistic assumption of zero-range interactions. We show via exact analytic methods that the combination of the two features yields a rich diversity of phenomena and permits an understanding of a variety of issues including spontaneous appearance of colonies. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {A classical random walker is characterized by a random position and velocity. This sort of random walk was originally proposed by Einstein to model Brownian motion and to demonstrate the existence of atoms and molecules. Such a walker represents an inanimate particle driven by environmental fluctuations. On the other hand, there are many examples of so-called “persistent random walkers,” including self-propelled particles that are able to move with almost constant speed while randomly changing their direction of motion. Examples include living entities (ranging from flagellated unicellular organisms to complex animals such as birds and fish), as well as synthetic materials. Here we discuss such persistent non-interacting random walkers as a model for active particles. We also present a model that includes interactions among particles, leading to a transition to flocking, that is, to a net flux where the majority of the particles move in the same direction. Moreover, the model exhibits secondary transitions that lead to clustering and more complex spatially structured states of flocking. We analyze all these transitions in terms of bifurcations using a number of mean field strategies (all to all interaction and advection-reaction equations for the spatially structured states), and compare these results with direct numerical simulations of ensembles of these interacting active particles.},

abstract = {The statistics of natural catastrophes contains very counter-intuitive results. Using earthquakes as a working example, we show that the energy radiated by such events follows a power-law or Pareto distribution. This means, in theory, that the expected value of the energy does not exist (is infinite), and in practice, that the mean of a finite set of data in not representative of the full population. Also, the distribution presents scale invariance, which implies that it is not possible to define a characteristic scale for the energy. A simple model to account for this peculiar statistics is a branching process: the activation or slip of a fault segment can trigger other segments to slip, with a certain probability, and so on. Although not recognized initially by seismologists, this is a particular case of the stochastic process studied by Galton and Watson one hundred years in advance, in order to model the extinction of (prominent) families. Using the formalism of probability generating functions we will be able to derive, in an accessible way, the main properties of these models. Remarkably, a power-law distribution of energies is only recovered in a very special case, when the branching process is at the onset of attenuation and intensification, i.e., at criticality. In order to account for this fact, we introduce the self-organized critical models, in which, by means of some feedback mechanism, the critical state becomes an attractor in the evolution of such systems. Analogies with statistical physics are drawn. The bulk of the material presented here is self-contained, as only elementary probability and mathematics are needed to start to read.},

abstract = {Glossary Time series One dimensional array of numbers (x i); i D 1; : : : ; N, representing values of an observable x usually measured equidistant (or nearly equidistant) in time. Complex system A system consisting of many non-linearly interacting components. It cannot be split into simpler subsystems without tampering with the dy-namical properties. Scaling law A power law with a scaling exponent (e. g. ˛) describing the behavior of a quantity F (e. g., fluctuation , spectral power) as function of a scale parameter s (e. g., time scale, frequency) at least asymptoti-cally: F(s) s ˛. The power law should be valid for a large range of s values, e. g., at least for one order of magnitude. Fractal system A system characterized by a scaling law with a fractal, i. e., non-integer exponent. Fractal systems are self-similar, i. e., a magnification of a small part is statistically equivalent to the whole. Self-affine system Generalization of a fractal system, where different magnifications s and s 0 D s H have to be used for different directions in order to obtain a statistically equivalent magnification. The exponent H is called Hurst exponent. Self-affine time series and time series becoming self-affine upon integration are commonly denoted as fractal using a less strict terminology. Multifractal system A system characterized by scaling laws with an infinite number of different fractal exponents. The scaling laws must be valid for the same range of the scale parameter. Crossover Change point in a scaling law, where one scaling exponent applies for small scale parameters and another scaling exponent applies for large scale parameters. The center of the crossover is denoted by its characteristic scale parameter s in this article. Persistence In a persistent time series, a large value is usually (i. e., with high statistical preference) followed by a large value and a small value is followed by a small value. A fractal scaling law holds at least for a limited range of scales. Short-term correlations Correlations that decay sufficiently fast that they can be described by a characteristic correlation time scale; e. g., exponentially decaying correlations. A crossover to uncorrelated behavior is observed on larger scales. Long-term correlations Correlations that decay sufficiently slow that a characteristic correlation time scale cannot be defined; e. g., power-law correlations with an exponent between 0 and 1. Power-law scaling is observed on large time scales and asymptotically. The term long-range correlations should be used if the data is not a time series. Non-stationarities If the mean or the standard deviation of the data values change with time, the weak definition of stationarity is violated. The strong definition of stationarity requires that all moments remain constant, i. e., the distribution density of the values does not change with time. Non-stationarities like monotonous, periodic, or step-like trends are often caused by external effects. In a more general sense, changes in the dynamics of the system also represent non-stationarities. Definition of the Subject Data series generated by complex systems exhibit fluctuations on a wide range of time scales and/or broad distributions of the values. In both equilibrium and non-equilibrium situations, the natural fluctuations are often found to follow a scaling relation over several orders of magnitude. Such scaling laws allow for a characterization of the data and the generating complex system by frac-tal (or multifractal) scaling exponents, which can serve as characteristic fingerprints of the systems in comparisons with other systems and with models. Fractal scaling behavior has been observed, e. g., in many data series from experimental physics, geophysics, medicine, physiology, and 464 Fractal and Multifractal Time Series even social sciences. Although the underlying causes of the observed fractal scaling are often not known in detail, the fractal or multifractal characterization can be used for generating surrogate (test) data, modeling the time series, and deriving predictions regarding extreme events or future behavior. The main application, however, is still the characterization of different states or phases of the complex system based on the observed scaling behavior. For example , the health status and different physiological states of the human cardiovascular system are represented by the fractal scaling behavior of the time series of intervals between successive heartbeats, and the coarsening dynamics in metal alloys are represented by the fractal scaling of the time-dependent speckle intensities observed in coherent X-ray spectroscopy. In order to observe fractal and multifractal scaling behavior in time series, several tools have been developed. Besides older techniques assuming stationary data, there are more recently established methods differentiating truly fractal dynamics from fake scaling behavior caused by non-stationarities in the data. In addition, short-term and long-term correlations have to be clearly distinguished to show fractal scaling behavior unambiguously. This article describes several methods originating from statistical physics and applied mathematics, which have been used for fractal and multifractal time series analysis in stationary and non-stationary data.},

abstract = {This paper amplifies upon earlier theories and observations by the authors, advances a probabilistic model of rain fields, and exhibits realistic simulations, which the reader is advised to scan before continuing with the text. The model is also compared with other approaches. The theory of fractals has been in part motivated by the Hurst effect, which is an empirical observation in hydrology and climatology. A fractal is an unsmooth shape that is scaling, that is, where shape appears unchanged when examined by varying magnifications. The study of fractals is characterized by the prevalence of hyperbolically distributed random variables, for which Pr(U{\textgreater} u) ∝ u a, where Pr is the probability that the value of the variable exceeds u, and a is a positive exponent. Lovejoy established the applicability of fractals in meteorology, by showing that cloud and rain areas project on the Earth along shapes whose boundaries are fractal curves, and that the temporal and spatial structure of rain is rife with hyperbolically distributed features. These observations, as amplified in this paper, set up the challenge of constructing fractal models with the observed properties. The models presented here belong to a very versatile family of random processes devised in Mandelbrot: fractal sums of (simple) pulses, or FSP processes. The simulations to be presented reveal that these processes involve a scaling heirarchy of “bands”, “fronts”, and “clusters”, as well as other complex shapes, none of which had been deliberately incorporated in the process. This very rich morphology and the related statistical distributions exemplify the power of simple fractal models to generate complex structures, and are in accord with the wide diversity of actual rainfall shapes. It is argued that this model already provides a useful context in which the basic statistical properties of the rainfield, including the relationship between the temporal and spatial structure, may be studied. 1985 Blackwell Munksgaard},

The temporal data exhibited scaling for moments of orders up to 2.5 in the monsoon area and up to 4.0 in the temperate area and showed clear multifractal properties in both climates. Second, daily spatial rainfall distributions were pooled into different rainfall-generating mechanism groups, and each group was analyzed separately. The spatial data for all rainfall mechanisms in the two climates exhibited scaling for moments of orders up to 4.0. The scaling regime was 15-180 km (225-32,400 km2) in the monsoon climate and 7.5-90 km 55-8100 km2) in the temperate climate A multifractal framework seemed well suited for description of convective-type rainfall in both climates, but its suitability for frontal rainfall in the two regions was less clear.

It is shown that power law scaling, commonly assumed by analyses and models of point rainfall, cannot hold over all scales of observation and that an "inner" regime exists for small sampling intervals where the variance is a quadratic function of interval length. A power law scaling regime is shown to exist for larger aggregation intervals, whose characteristics depend on the memory of the continuous rainfall process. The presence of a "transition" regime between the inner and the scaling regime is also shown and may explain the deviations from a power law scaling behavior in observed rainfall reported in the literature. Furthermore, the application of the theory to rainfall data from a representative variety of climate types shows that fractal and multifractal analysis techniques and models may indeed fail to capture observed rainfall properties over wide ranges of aggregation scales. Finally, correlation structures with "short-" and "long-"term memory are considered and different theoretical relationships expressing rainfall variance as a function of aggregation interval are derived and tested against rainfall observed at different locations with aggregation timescales ranging from 15 min to 2 days. The theoretical and observational analyses show that both finite and infinite memory rainfall processes may be observed in nature.},

abstract = {[1] The identification of general relationships linking statistical properties of rainfall aggregated at different temporal and spatial scales possesses clear theoretical and practical relevance. Among other properties it is important to characterize the scale dependence of rainfall variability, which may, for many purposes, be summarized by its variance. This paper presents theoretical results and observational analyses connecting the variance of temporal and spatial rainfall to the scale of observation under an assumption of second-order stationarity. Previous results regarding the theoretical form of the temporal variance as a function of aggregation are refined and extended to the spatial case. It is shown that the variance of aggregated rainfall exhibits an overall nonscaling form within the range of scales of usual hydrological interest. It is further shown that the theoretically derived form of the variance as a function of scale is incompatible with power law relations usually assumed for the second-order statistical moment within multiscaling approaches to rainfall modeling. Predictions of the theoretical derivations are validated by use of observations representing a wide variety of resolutions (from 2 s to 1 hour in time and 4 km in space), climates, and measurement instruments. The validation shows a good agreement between observations and the theoretically predicted forms of the variance as a function of aggregation. The proposed theoretical framework thus provides a useful context for rainfall analysis, modeling, and downscaling in space and time and suggests careful reexaminations of usual multiscaling assumptions.

The analysis suggests that variations in channel hydraulics and active layer composition alone may not explain the observed reductions in sediment transport. Further, the experiments appear to cover a crucial range of mean bed shear stresses for armouring studies, ranging between a condition of passive winnowing, to one of more active armour development in which the coarse grains play a role in determining bed structure. This indicates that the active layer concept, commonly applied in computer models of graded sediment transport, may be limited in its application.},

abstract = {A series of flume experiments were conducted in a large experimental channel at the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory to understand the coupled dynamics of flow and bed forms above the sediment-water interface. Simultaneous high resolution measurements of velocity fluctuations, bed elevations and sediment flux at the downstream end of the channel, were made for a range of discharges. The probability density functions (pdfs) of bed elevation increments and instantaneous Reynolds stress reveal a power law tail behavior and a wavelet cross-correlation analysis depicts a strong dependence of these series across a range of scales, indicating a feedback between bed form dynamics and near-bed turbulence. These results complement our previous findings in which the signature of bed form evolution on the near-bed velocity fluctuations was confirmed via the presence of a spectral gap and two distinct power law scaling regimes in the spectral density of velocity fluctuations. We report herein a strong asymmetry in the probability distribution of bed elevation increments and instantaneous Reynolds stresses, the latter being further analyzed and interpreted via a quadrant analysis of velocity fluctuations in the longitudinal and vertical directions. We also report the presence of intermittency (multifractality) in bed elevation increments and interpret it, in view of the asymmetric nature of the pdfs, as the result of scale coupling. In other words, the geometric asymmetry at the bed form scale gets transferred down to a probabilistic asymmetry at all smaller scales indicating a local anisotropy in the energy transfer. Finally, we propose a predictive relationship between bed form averaged sediment transport rates and bed form averaged instantaneous Reynolds stress and validate it using our experimental data. {\textcopyright} 2012.

abstract = {Under the theory of independent and identically distributed random cascades, the probability distribution of the cascade generator determines the spatial and the ensemble properties of spatial rainfall. Three sets of radar-derived rainfall data in space and time are analyzed to estimate the probability distribution of the generator. A detailed comparison between instantaneous scans of spatial rainfall and simulated cascades using the scaling properties of the marginal moments is carried out. This comparison highlights important similarities and differences between the data and the random cascade theory. Differences are quantified and measured for the three datasets. Evidence is presented to show that the scaling properties of the rainfall can be captured to the first order by a random cascade with a single parameter. The dependence of this parameter on forcing by the large-scale meteorological conditions, as measured by the large-scale spatial average rain rate, is investigated for these three datasets. The data show that this dependence can be captured by a one-to-one function. Since the large-scale average rain rate can be diagnosed from the large-scale dynamics, this relationship demonstrates an important linkage between the large-scale atmospheric dynamics and the statistical cascade theory of mesoscale rainfall. Potential application of this research to parameterization of runoff from the land surface and regional flood frequency analysis is briefly discussed, and open problems for further research are presented.},

In particular, we explore two methods based on the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and the Wavelet Transform Modulus Maxima (WTMM): the partition function method and the newer and more efficient magnitude cumulant analysis method. We also report the results of a two-point magnitude correlation analysis which is able to infer the presence or absence of multiplicativity as the underlying mechanism of scaling. The diagnostic power of these methodologies for small samples, signals with short ranges of scaling, and signals for which high-frequency fluctuations are superimposed on a low-frequency component (all common attributes of geophysical signals) is carefully documented. Application of these methodologies to several midwestern convective storms sampled every 5 s over several hours provides new insights. They reveal the presence of a very intermittent multifractal structure (a wide spectrum of singularities) in rainfall fluctuations between the scales of 5 min and the storm pulse duration (of the order of 1-2 hours for the analyzed storms). The two-point magnitude statistical analysis suggests that this structure is consistent with a multiplicative cascading mechanism which however is local in nature; that is, it applies only within each storm pulse but not over the whole storm duration.

abstract = {[1] Tracer pebbles are widely used to learn about gravel transport along rivers. Movement over short times and distances is dominated by factors controlling entrainment: relative particle size and shear stress. Movement at longer scales also involves depositional factors: burial and reexposure and exchange between channels, bars, and other depositional environments. We mapped mixed-size tracers in six reaches of a small Scottish river after 2 ahd 8 years to investigate differences in relative and absolute mobility and infer the importance of burial and exchange. Patterns of relative mobility according to size and shear stress, both within and between reaches, did not change significantly. Some local bunching of tracers was apparent in both surveys, with redistribution from pools into riffles and bars. The main change was that virtual velocities were ∼50{\%} lower, and estimated gravel fluxes were also lower, in the longer term. This slowdown is attributed to vertical mixing giving decreased mobility as surface-seeded tracers become buried, long-term storage in bars and other less active parts of the system, and in this channel, advection of tracers downstream onto a finer bed giving higher relative size.},

abstract = {Low-sinuosity meandering gravel-bed flume experiments were employed to investigate spatial patterns of deposition, which point to patterns of channel development related to the pool and bar morphology. At channel-forming discharges, fluorescent bedload tracers indicate that deposition is typically focused around the point bar apex, downstream of the apex (contributing to downstream bar migration), and at the bar head/riffle surface. Seven flume experimental runs illustrate a sequence of point bar development related to the spatial patterns of tracer deposition, and the related path length distribution. At early stages of bar formation, transport is from the scour zone across the point bar head to the bar apex and bar margin downstream of the apex. As the point bar develops, bedload transport across the bar decreases, as transport along the channel thalweg increases and sediment is deposited along the bar margin. Deposition cells appear to move from downstream to upstream of the bar apex as this sequence of bar formation progresses. At low (non-channel-forming) discharges, transport occurs to the bar head/riffle surface with very little material being transported to the apex region or point bar interior. The implication is that there is an inherent connection between the loci of particle deposition and point bar formation, largely controlled by the morphology of the channel. {\textcopyright} 2005 International Association of Sedimentologists.},

Mixing slowdown, which is always present, is simulated using a Markov model of exchanges between three stores and assumptions about relative mean velocities of tracers in each store. The model can be calibrated from a full search on one date and at least a surface search on another date. Calibration to six reaches of Allt Dubhaig, Scotland, in which tracers were mapped after 2 and 8 years, Suggests mixing took 3-5 years to approach equilibrium in five reaches and was still proceeding in one.

Magnetically tagged gravels deployed in Carnation Creek have been monitored repeatedly over 17. years. Four metrics used to describe the extent of dispersion document that the overall shape in the spatial distribution of grain location changes over time. The general trends mask the complexity of the dispersion process, expressed by channel sections where tracers are concentrated regardless of grain size. The distribution of total grain displacement responsible for dispersion evolves as tracers become well mixed. Results demonstrate that observations from the field are crucial to the understanding and modeling of sediment dispersion because they provide key insights into the dispersion process that must be known a priori for mathematical modeling and similar observations cannot be collected using laboratory flumes. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

From the point of entrainment, local particle diffusion in all three coordinate directions displays an exponent significantly greater than that of ballistic diffusion. In contrast, particle motion after collision with the bed demonstrates ballistic diffusion in all three coordinate directions. The results highlight clear differences between the diffusion of an already mobile particle and one starting from a position of rest. These differences are attributed to variations in physical mechanisms acting at the initial phase of particle motion after detachment from the bed.},

abstract = {The permeability of river beds is an important control on hyporheic flow and the movement of fine sediment and solutes into and out of the bed. However, relatively little is known about the effect of bed permeability on overlying near-bed flow dynamics, and thus on fluid advection at the sediment–water interface. This study provides the first quantification of this effect for water-worked gravel beds. Laboratory experiments in a recirculating flume revealed that flows over permeable beds exhibit fundamental differences compared with flows over impermeable beds of the same topography. The turbulence over permeable beds is less intense, more organised and more efficient at momentum transfer because eddies are more coherent. Furthermore, turbulent kinetic energy is lower, meaning that less energy is extracted from the mean flow by this turbulence. Consequently, the double-averaged velocity is higher and the bulk flow resistance is lower over permeable beds, and there is a difference in how momentum is conveyed from the overlying flow to the bed surface. The main implications of these results are three-fold. First, local pressure gradients, and therefore rates of material transport, across the sediment–water interface are likely to differ between impermeable and permeable beds. Second, near-bed and hyporheic flows are unlikely to be adequately predicted by numerical models that represent the bed as an impermeable boundary. Third, more sophisticated flow resistance models are required for coarse-grained rivers that consider not only the bed surface but also the underlying permeable structure. Overall, our results suggest that the effects of bed permeability have critical implications for hyporheic exchange, fluvial sediment dynamics and benthic habitat availability. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors.

abstract = {The containment of genetically modified (GM) pollen is an issue of significant concern for many countries. For crops that are bee-pollinated, model predictions of outcrossing rates depend on the movement hypothesis used for the pollinators. Previous work studying pollen spread by honeybees, the most important pollinator worldwide, was based on the assumption that honeybee movement can be well approximated by Brownian motion. A number of recent studies, however, suggest that pollinating insects such as bees perform L{\'{e}}vy flights in their search for food. Such flight patterns yield much larger rates of spread, and so the Brownian motion assumption might significantly underestimate the risk associated with GM pollen outcrossing in conventional crops. In this work, we propose a mechanistic model for pollen dispersal in which the bees performtruncated L{\'{e}}vy flights. This assumption leads to a fractional- order diffusion model for pollen that can be tuned to model motion ranging from pure Brownian to pure L{\'{e}}vy. We parametrize our new model by taking the samepollen dispersal dataset used in Brownianmotionmodelling studies. By numerically solving themodel equations,we showthat the isolation distances required to keep outcrossing levels belowa certain threshold are substantially increased by comparison with the original predictions, suggesting that isolation distances may need to be much larger than originally thought.},

However, determining the relation between rainfall and river dynamics requires a greater understanding of the feedbacks between flooding and a river's capacity to transport sediment.We analyzed channel geometry and stream-flow records from186 coarse-grained rivers across the United States.We found that channels adjust their shape so that floods slightly exceed the critical shear velocity needed to transport bed sediment, independently of climatic, tectonic, and bedrock controls.The distribution of fluid shear velocity associated with floods is universal, indicating that self-organization of near-critical channels filters the climate signal evident in discharge.This effect blunts the impact of extreme rainfall events on landscape evolution.},

More generally, however, one expects that for a large class of $\rho$(E), 'interrupted' aging effects appear at low enough temperatures, with an ergodic time growing faster than exponentially. The relaxation functions exhibit a characteristic shoulder, which can be fitted as stretched exponentials. A simple way of introducing interactions between the particles leads to a modified model with an effective diffusion constant in energy space, which we discuss in detail. {\textcopyright} 1996 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

But in disordered systems anomalous diffusion may occur, in which the mean-square displacement is proportional to some other power of time. In the presence of moderate concentrations of obstacles, diffusion is anomalous over short distances and normal over long distances. Monte Carlo calculations are used to characterize anomalous diffusion for obstacle concentrations between zero and the percolation threshold. As the obstacle concentration approaches the percolation threshold, diffusion becomes more anomalous over longer distances; the anomalous diffusion exponent and the crossover length both increase.

Over the past few decades sophisticated experiments and data collection in numerous biological, physical and financial systems have revealed anomalous sub-diffusion in which the mean square displacement grows slower than linearly with time. A major theoretical challenge has been to derive the appropriate evolution equation for the probability density function of sub-diffusion taking into account further complications from force fields and reactions. Here we present a derivation of the generalised master equation for an ensemble of particles undergoing reactions whilst being subject to an external force field. From this general equation we show reductions to a range of well known special cases, including the fractional reaction diffusion equation and the fractional Fokker-Planck equation. {\textcopyright} 2013 EDP Sciences.},

For instance, whereas the average number of distinct sites visited by an immortal walker grows with time without bound, that of a mortal walker may, depending on dimensionality and rate of evanescence, remain finite or keep growing with the passage of time. This number can in turn be used to calculate other classic quantities such as the survival probability of a target surrounded by diffusing traps. If the traps are immortal, the survival probability will vanish with increasing time. However, if the traps are evanescent, the target may be spared a certain death. We analytically calculate a number of basic and broadly used quantities for evanescent random walkers. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

The anomalous features of diffusion result from the modulation of the diffusion coefficient caused by transitions between ATSM states. The anomalous space-time evolution predicted by the ATSM is treated within the continuous time random walk theory. With the use of the proposed ATSM the transient behavior of the AD and the ADAT is analyzed in detail. We found a large variety of different (and sometimes peculiar) types of the space-time behavior of the free AD and ADAT. The free AD is found to be of subdiffusion or superdiffusion type for fairly long time depending on the relation between the parameters of the ATSM.

abstract = {Transient phenomena in the rate of nucleation are of importance in the interpretation of experimental data on nucleation in the H2SO 4-H2O vapor system. Furthermore, fluctuations in the rate of nucleation can actually be measured. In view of these facts, a stochastic approach to the theory of nucleation is developed with eventual application to the H2SO4-H2O system. The central goal of the theory is the evaluation of the distribution of "first passage times," for a nucleus, over the relevant free energy barrier. This distribution is calculated from the distribution of a "walker" on a lattice. However, the distribution of the walker is derived from a "master equation," and for this purpose it is demonstrated that walks on lattices and master equations are, in this sense, "equivalent" even for a lattice which is not translationally invariant. Given the distribution of first passage times, it is possible to compute the transient rate of nucleation, as well as the distribution of fluctuations of the rate about some instantaneous mean. This theory is then applied to the H2SO4-H2O vapor system, and the results indicate that, under many typical experimental conditions, the time to reach the steady state may be quite long (hundreds or thousands of seconds), but that nevertheless, some nucleation should be observed in the laboratory time frame (in agreement with experiment). The character of nucleation as an "extreme event" is demonstrated by the appearance of a large band gap in the spectrum of relaxation times for the process.

abstract = {Anomalous transport in porous media is commonly believed to be induced by the highly complex pore space geometry. However, this phenomenon is also observed in porous media with rather simple pore structure. In order to answer how ubiquitous can anomalous transport be in porous media, we in this work systematically investigate the solute transport process in a simple porous medium model with minimal structural randomness. The porosities we consider range widely from 0.30 up to 0.85, and we find by lattice Boltzmann simulations that the solute transport process can be anomalous in all cases at high P{\'{e}}clet numbers. We use the continuous time random walk theory to quantitatively explain the observed scaling relations of the process. A plausible hydrodynamic origin of anomalous transport in simple porous media is proposed as a complement to its widely accepted geometric origin in complex porous media. Our results, together with previous findings, provide evidence that anomalous transport is indeed ubiquitous in porous media. Consequently, attentions should be paid when modelling solute transport by the classical advection-diffusion equation, which could lead to systematic error.},

abstract = {Non-Fickian (or anomalous) transport of contaminants has been observed at field and laboratory scales in a wide variety of porous and fractured geological formations. Over many years a basic challenge to the hydrology community has been to develop a theoretical framework that quantitatively accounts for this widespread phenomenon. Recently, continuous time random walk (CTRW) formulations have been demonstrated to provide general and effective means to quantify non-Fickian transport. We introduce and develop the CTRW framework from its conceptual picture of transport through its mathematical development to applications relevant to laboratory- and field-scale systems. The CTRW approach contrasts with ones used extensively on the basis of the advection-dispersion equation and use of upscaling, volume averaging, and homogenization. We examine the underlying assumptions, scope, and differences of these approaches, as well as stochastic formulations, relative to CTRW. We argue why these methods have not been successful in fitting actual measurements. The CTRW has now been developed within the framework of partial differential equations and has been generalized to apply to nonstationary domains and interactions with immobile states (matrix effects). We survey models based on multirate mass transfer (mobile-immobile) and fractional derivatives and show their connection as subsets within the CTRW framework.

abstract = {Hairsine and Rose developed a mechanistic, one-dimensional, precipitation-driven erosion model that, since its appearance, has been validated by several sets of experimental results. The model allows any sediment particle to be present in one of three zones, viz., the flow zone, the deposited layer, or the original soil. The model has the general form of a two-region model, in which advection is the only transport process. For the special case of a soil composed of a single particle size and for overland flow that occurs at a steady rate and with a uniform depth, it is possible to derive fully explicit analytical solutions to the model. Details of the solutions for a slightly generalized mathematical form of the model are provided. The Goldstein J function, which appears commonly in two-region model solutions, was modified to accommodate some of the solutions presented. The form of the model analyzed indicated that, based only on sediment concentrations in runoff water, it is not possible to distinguish one mechanistic feature of the Hairsine-Rose model, i.e., that raindrop-induced detachment of the undisturbed soil moves directly into the flowing water. From the point of view of the model, it is equally plausible for raindrop impact to move sediment directly into the deposited layer. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Despite this difference in per cent. adsorbed, barium and cobalt which oc-cur together in low concentrations in fission prod-ucts cannot be separated from one another to give samples of high radioactive purity, since the amount of barium adsorbed, while considerably less than the amount of cobalt adsorbed, is still quite large. (4) The relative extent of adsorption of cobalt and barium is the reverse of that reported by Iiress-man and Kitchener for the adsorption of these ions on a phenol sulfonic ac.id resin.3 They indicate that the extent of adsorption of cobalt is determined by the ion association of cobalt ions and a ((primary determining factor, which may or may not be ionic size." In the case of adsorption on hydrous ferric oxide, it is believed that a more significant factor is the weakly basic character of cobalt, that is, the hy-drolysis of cobalt ion is a controlling factor in its adsorption by the very weakly acidic adsorbent, hydrous ferric oxide.

Despite its resemblance to numerous real-world phenomena, the singular nature of the resultant spatial distribution of each particle precludes the possibility of any a posteriori empirical validation of this random-walk model from data. Here we show that by simply allowing for random speeds, the ballistic terms are regularized and that the diffusion component can be well-approximated via the unscented transform. The result is a computationally efficient yet robust evaluation of the full particle path probabilities and, hence, the parameter likelihoods of this generalized telegraph process. We demonstrate how a population diffusing under such a model can lead to non-Gaussian asymptotic spatial distributions, thereby mimicking the behavior of an ensemble of L{\'{e}}vy walkers.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to implement a random death process into a persistent random walk model which produces sub-ballistic superdiffusion (L{\'{e}}vy walk). We develop a stochastic two-velocity jump model of cell motility for which the switching rate depends upon the time which the cell has spent moving in one direction. It is assumed that the switching rate is a decreasing function of residence (running) time. This assumption leads to the power law for the velocity switching time distribution. This describes the anomalous persistence of cell motility: the longer the cell moves in one direction, the smaller the switching probability to another direction becomes. We derive master equations for the cell densities with the generalized switching terms involving the tempered fractional material derivatives. We show that the random death of cells has an important implication for the transport process through tempering of the superdiffusive process. In the long-time limit we write stationary master equations in terms of exponentially truncated fractional derivatives in which the rate of death plays the role of tempering of a L{\'{e}}vy jump distribution. We find the upper and lower bounds for the stationary profiles corresponding to the ballistic transport and diffusion with the death-rate-dependent diffusion coefficient. Monte Carlo simulations confirm these bounds.},

abstract = {An increasing number of natural phenomena do not fit into the relatively simple description of diffusion developed by Einstein a century ago  AS ALL of us are no doubt aware, this year has been declared "world year of physics" to celebrate the three remarkable breakthroughs made by Albert Einstein in 1905. However, it is not so well known that Einstein's work on Brownian motion – the random motion of tiny particles first observed and investigated by the botanist Robert Brown in 1827 – has been cited more times in the scientific literature than his more famous papers on special relativity and the quantum nature of light. In a series of publications that included his doctoral thesis, Einstein derived an equation for Brownian motion from microscopic principles – a feat that ultimately enabled Jean Perrin and others to prove the existence of atoms (see "Einstein's random walk" Physics World January pp19–22).   Einstein was not the only person thinking about this type of problem. The 27 July 1905 issue of Nature contained a letter with the title "The problem of the random walk" by the British statistician Karl Pearson, who was interested in the way that mosquitoes spread malaria, which he showed was described by the well-known diffusion equation. As such, the displacement of a mosquito from its initial position is proportional to the square root of time, and the distribution of the positions of many such "random walkers" starting from the same origin is Gaussian in form. The random walk has since turned out to be intimately linked to Einstein's work on Brownian motion, and has become a major tool for understanding diffusive processes in nature.},

abstract = {Mathematical modelling of the movement of animals, micro-organisms and cells is of great relevance in the fields of biology, ecology and medicine. Movement models can take many different forms, but the most widely used are based on the extensions of simple random walk processes. In this review paper, our aim is twofold: to introduce the mathematics behind random walks in a straightforward manner and to explain how such models can be used to aid our understanding of biological processes. We introduce the mathematical theory behind the simple random walk and explain how this relates to Brownian motion and diffusive processes in general. We demonstrate how these simple models can be extended to include drift and waiting times or be used to calculate first passage times. We discuss biased random walks and show how hyperbolic models can be used to generate correlated random walks. We cover two main applications of the random walk model. Firstly, we review models and results relating to the movement, dispersal and population redistribution of animals and micro-organisms. This includes direct calculation of mean squared displacement, mean dispersal distance, tortuosity measures, as well as possible limitations of these model approaches. Secondly, oriented movement and chemotaxis models are reviewed. General hyperbolic models based on the linear transport equation are introduced and we show how a reinforced random walk can be used to model movement where the individual changes its environment. We discuss the applications of these models in the context of cell migration leading to blood vessel growth (angiogenesis). Finally, we discuss how the various random walk models and approaches are related and the connections that underpin many of the key processes involved. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Royal Society.},

We consider a general CTRW with symmetric and continuous (but otherwise arbitrary) jump length distribution f($\eta$) and arbitrary waiting time distribution $\psi$($\tau$). The traps are initially distributed uniformly in space with density $\rho$. We prove an exact relation, valid for all time t, between P s(t) and the expected maximum E[M(t)] of the trap process up to time t, for rather general stochastic motion x trap(t) of each trap. When x trap(t) represents a general CTRW with arbitrary f($\eta$) and $\psi$($\tau$), we are able to compute exactly the first two leading terms in the asymptotic behavior of E[M(t)] for large t. This allows us subsequently to compute the precise asymptotic behavior, P s(t) ∼ a exp[ - bt], for large t, with exact expressions for the stretching exponent and the constants a and b for arbitrary CTRW. By choosing appropriate f($\eta$) and $\psi$($\tau$), we recover the previously known results for diffusive and subdiffusive traps.

abstract = {In steep headwater reaches, episodic mass movements can deliver large volumes of sediment to fluvial channels. If these inputs of sediment occur with a high frequency and magnitude, the capacity of the stream to rework the supplied material can be exceeded for a significant amount of time. To study the equilibrium conditions in a channel following different episodic sediment supply regimes (defined by grain size distribution, frequency, and magnitude of events), we simulate sediment transport through an idealized reach with our numerical 1-D model {\textless}q{\textgreater}BESMo{\textless}/q{\textgreater} (Bedload Scenario Model). The model performs well in replicating flume experiments of a similar scope (where sediment was fed constantly, in one, two, or four pulses) and allowed the exploration of alternative event sequences. We show that in these experiments, the order of events is not important in the long term, as the channel quickly recovers even from high magnitude events. In longer equilibrium simulations, we imposed different supply regimes on a channel, which after some time leads to an adjustment of slope, grain size, and sediment transport that is in equilibrium with the respective forcing conditions. We observe two modes of channel adjustment to episodic sediment supply. (1) High-frequency supply regimes lead to equilibrium slopes and armouring ratios that are like conditions in constant-feed simulations. In these cases, the period between pulses is shorter than a {\textless}q{\textgreater}fluvial evacuation time{\textless}/q{\textgreater}, which we approximate as the time it takes to export a pulse of sediment under average transport conditions. (2) In low-frequency regimes the pulse period (i.e., recurrence interval) exceeds the {\textless}q{\textgreater}fluvial evacuation time{\textless}/q{\textgreater}, leading to higher armouring ratios due to the longer exposure of the bed surface to flow. If the grain size distribution of the bed is fine and armouring weak, the model predicts a decrease in the average channel slope. The ratio between the {\textless}q{\textgreater}fluvial evacuation time{\textless}/q{\textgreater} and the pulse period constitutes a threshold that can help to quantify how a system responds to episodic disturbances.},

abstract = {As the result of current and historical metal mining, river channels and floodplains in many parts of the world have become contaminated by metal-rich waste in concentrations that may pose a hazard to human livelihoods and sustainable development. Environmental and human health impacts commonly arise because of the prolonged residence time of heavy metals in river sediments and alluvial soils and their bioaccumulatory nature in plants and animals. This paper considers how an understanding of the processes of sediment-associated metal dispersion in rivers, and the space and timescales over which they operate, can be used in a practical way to help river basin managers more effectively control and remediate catchments affected by current and historical metal mining. A geomorphological approach to the management of rivers contaminated by metals is outlined and four emerging research themes are highlighted and critically reviewed. These are: (1) response and recovery of river systems following the failures of major tailings dams; (2) effects of flooding on river contamination and the sustainable use of floodplains; (3) new developments in isotopic fingerprinting, remote sensing and numerical modelling for identifying the sources of contaminant metals and for mapping the spatial distribution of contaminants in river channels and floodplains; and (4) current approaches to the remediation of river basins affected by mining, appraised in light of the European Union's Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC). Future opportunities for geomorphologically-based assessments of mining-affected catchments are also identified. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Protecting the world's freshwater resources requires diagnosing threats over a broad range of scales, from global to local. Here we present the first worldwide synthesis to jointly consider human and biodiversity perspectives on water security using a spatial framework that quantifies multiple stressors and accounts for downstream impacts. We find that nearly 80{\%} of the world's population is exposed to high levels of threat to water security. Massive investment in water technology enables rich nations to offset high stressor levels without remedying their underlying causes, whereas less wealthy nations remain vulnerable. A similar lack of precautionary investment jeopardizes biodiversity, with habitats associated with 65{\%} of continental discharge classified as moderately to highly threatened. The cumulative threat framework offers a tool for prioritizing policy and management responses to this crisis, and underscores the necessity of limiting threats at their source instead of through costly remediation of symptoms in order to assure global water security for both humans and freshwater biodiversity.},

abstract = {The adjustment of a gravel bed during cycles of sediment storage was analyzed for a flume experiment, designed to study the effects of episodic sediment supply regimes. As the bed aggraded and degraded due to changes in sediment feed, it developed a complex topography with bedforms at different scales (e.g., pebble-clusters, bars). Sediment inputs increased bedload rates and promoted large changes in bed morphology. Without an external supply, the bed armored, which increased bed stability, counteracted bed degradation, and decreased bedload rates. Fully-mobile gravel (2–8 mm) was the only fraction that exhibited a deficit over the experiment. Preferential storage of coarse grains caused the development of a sediment wedge upstream and downstream fining on the bed surface. The storage of sand was also significant (60{\%} of feed) probably because of infiltration (e.g., in the upstream wedge) and hiding effects promoted by bed armor and structures. Size-selective transport caused a cumulative increase in bed slope, which was likely to affect sediment transport capacity. The large variability in bedload rates for same levels of bed storage indicated that sediment availability and bed state were the main controls on sediment transport regime. We provide empirical evidence that cycles of aggradation and degradation, caused by changes in sediment feed upstream, condition bed composition and topography, and the rate and texture of sediment output.},

abstract = {A river at equilibrium is described by a statistically-stationary mean bed elevation profile that arises in response to steady supplies of relief, water and sediment. Outside of the profile shape, how is the equilibrium state of a river most reliably identified and rigorously defined? Motivated by a proposed link between equilibrium and physical processes, we use scaling theory to develop the dimensionless channel response number $\xi$=KUb/Up. $\xi$ is a metric for the local disequilibrium state of gravel-bed mountain streams, which reflects a balance between the rate of topographic adjustment Ub, and the rate of bed sediment texture adjustment Up. The coefficient K can take one of two forms depending on choice of length scale for topographic adjustment. We hypothesize that equilibrium occurs where and when $\xi$≈O(1), and consequently, disequilibrium is the more general state captured by conditions of $\xi$≉O(1). The rates Ub and Up are controlled by the mechanics of sediment deposition and entrainment at the local scale of the channel width. The extent to which either process regulates disequilibrium depends on the bed strength, which is set by the time-varying grain size distribution and packing. We use flume experiments to understand $\xi$ and find that in the limit $\xi${\textgreater}{\textgreater}1, the time-varying response of an experimental channel depends sensitively on the spatially-averaged bed shear stress ratio $\tau$/$\tau$ref. When $\tau$/$\tau$ref≈1.5, Ub was the dominant control on disequilibrium. However, when $\tau$/$\tau$ref≈2.0, Up contributed more significantly to disequilibrium. These results suggest that after an upstream supply perturbation, the equilibrium timescale is governed by Up, which we show is consistent with expectations from linear damping theory. Our experimental test of $\xi$ is promising, but inconclusive with respect to our hypothesis. This uncertainty can be readily addressed with numerical or additional physical experiments. {\textcopyright} 2019 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

Investigations of hard-particle packing models have provided basic insights into the structure and bulk properties of condensed phases of matter, including low-temperature states (e.g., molecular and colloidal liquids, crystals, and glasses), multiphase heterogeneous media, granular media, and biological systems. The densest packings are of great interest in pure mathematics, including discrete geometry and number theory. This perspective reviews pertinent theoretical and computational literature concerning the equilibrium, metastable, and nonequilibrium packings of hard-particle packings in various Euclidean space dimensions. In the case of jammed packings, emphasis will be placed on the “geometric-structure” approach, which provides a powerful and unified means to quantitatively characterize individual packings via jamming categories and “order” maps. It incorporates extremal jammed states, including the densest packings, maximally random jammed states, and lowest-density jammed structures. Packings of identical spheres, spheres with a size distribution, and nonspherical particles are also surveyed. We close this review by identifying challenges and open questions for future research.},

abstract = {We investigate aging continuous time random walks (ACTRW), introduced by Monthus and Bouchaud [{\{}$\backslash$em J. Phys. A{\}} {\{}$\backslash$bf 29{\}}, 3847 (1996)]. Statistical behaviors of the displacement of the random walker {\$}{\{}\backslashbf r{\}}={\{}\backslashbf r{\}}(t) - {\{}\backslashbf r{\}}(0){\$} in the time interval {\$}(0,t){\$} are obtained, after aging the random walk in the time interval {\$}(-t{\_}a,0){\$}. In ACTRW formalism, the Green function {\$}P({\{}\backslashbf r{\}}, t{\_}a, t){\$} depends on the age of the random walk {\$}t{\_}a{\$} and the forward time {\$}t{\$}. We derive a generalized Montroll--Weiss equation, which yields an exact expression for the Fourier double Laplace transform of the ACTRW Green function. Asymptotic long times {\$}t{\_}a{\$} and {\$}t{\$} behaviors of the Green function are investigated in detail. In the limit of {\$}t\backslashgg t{\_}a{\$}, we recover the standard non-equilibrium CTRW behaviors, while the important regimes {\$}t\backslashll t{\_}a{\$} and {\$}t \backslashsimeq t{\_}a{\$} exhibit interesting aging effects. Convergence of the ACTRW results towards CTRW behavior, becomes extremely slow when the diffusion exponent becomes small. In the context of biased ACTRW, we investigate an aging Einstein relation. We briefly discuss aging in Scher-Montroll type of transport in disordered materials.},

abstract = {When the probability of measuring a particular value of some quantity varies inversely as a power of that value, the quantity is said to follow a power law, also known variously as Zipf's law or the Pareto distribution. Power laws appear widely in physics, biology, earth and planetary sciences, economics and finance, computer science, demography and the social sciences. For instance, the distributions of the sizes of cities, earthquakes, forest fires, solar flares, moon craters and people's personal fortunes all appear to follow power laws. The origin of power-law behaviour has been a topic of debate in the scientific community for more than a century. Here we review some of the empirical evidence for the existence of power-law forms and the theories proposed to explain them. {\textcopyright} 2005 Taylor {\&} Francis Group Ltd.},

abstract = {In many current morphodynamic models there is considerable process simplification and averaging. Such models are highly dependent on arbitrary parameterization and such limitations prevent both the complexity of the system and the feedback between processes being accurately represented. It is suggested here that an improvement in the empirical transport relations used in the morphodynamic modelling of gravel-bed rivers can potentially be derived from a combined computational fluid dynamics approach linked with a discrete particle model. It is proposed that this form of model, used under different hydraulic conditions and sediment particle characteristics, could provide process informed ranges of particle size-specific entrainment, transport and deposition characteristics which can be encapsulated in a probability distribution. Such process information could then be used to improve spatial and/or temporal parameterizations of reach-length morphodynamic models. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Modern microscopic techniques following the stochastic motion of labelled tracer particles have uncovered significant deviations from the laws of Brownian motion in a variety of animate and inanimate systems. Such anomalous diffusion can have different physical origins, which can be identified from careful data analysis. In particular, single particle tracking provides the entire trajectory of the traced particle, which allows one to evaluate different observables to quantify the dynamics of the system under observation. We here provide an extensive overview over different popular anomalous diffusion models and their properties. We pay special attention to their ergodic properties, highlighting the fact that in several of these models the long time averaged mean squared displacement shows a distinct disparity to the regular, ensemble averaged mean squared displacement. In these cases, data obtained from time averages cannot be interpreted by the standard theoretical results for the ensemble averages. Here we therefore provide a comparison of the main properties of the time averaged mean squared displacement and its statistical behaviour in terms of the scatter of the amplitudes between the time averages obtained from different trajectories. We especially demonstrate how anomalous dynamics may be identified for systems, which, on first sight, appear to be Brownian. Moreover, we discuss the ergodicity breaking parameters for the different anomalous stochastic processes and showcase the physical origins for the various behaviours. This Perspective is intended as a guidebook for both experimentalists and theorists working on systems, which exhibit anomalous diffusion. {\textcopyright} the Partner Organisations 2014.},

Such a process, called a L{\'{e}}vy walk, describes dynamical behaviors of many physical systems, fluorescence intermittency of semiconductor nanocrystals under continuous laser illumination being one example. When the mean sojourn time diverges the process is non-ergodic. In that case, the time average autocorrelation function is not equal to the ensemble averaged autocorrelation function, instead it remains random even in the limit of long measurement time. Several approximations for the distribution of this random autocorrelation function are obtained for different parameter ranges, and favorably compared to Monte Carlo simulations. Nonergodicity of the power spectrum of the process is briefly discussed, and a nonstationary Wiener-Khintchine theorem, relating the correlation functions and the power spectrum is presented. The considered situation is in full contrast to the usual assumptions of ergodicity and stationarity. {\textcopyright} Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. 2006.},

abstract = {Accurately estimating the 3D position of underwater objects is of great interest when doing research on marine animals. An inherent problem of 3D reconstruction of underwater positions is the presence of refraction which invalidates the assumption of a single viewpoint. Three ways of performing 3D reconstruction on underwater objects are compared in this work: an approach relying solely on in-air camera calibration, an approach with the camera calibration performed under water and an approach based on ray tracing with Snell's law. As expected, the in-air camera calibration showed to be the most inaccurate as it does not take refraction into account. The precision of the estimated 3D positions based on the underwater camera calibration and the ray tracing based approach were, on the other hand, almost identical. However, the ray tracing based approach is found to be advantageous as it is far more flexible in terms of the calibration procedure due to the decoupling of the intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters.},

Turning our attention to spatially 1-D CTRWs with a generic power law jump distribution, "rescaling" space can be interpreted as a second kind of "respeeding" which then, again under a proper relation between the relevant parameters leads in the limit to the space-time fractional diffusion equation. Finally, we treat the `time fractional drift" process as a properly scaled limit of the counting number of a Mittag-Leffler renewal process.},

Using Laplace analysis, we derive analytic expressions in terms of Mittag-Leffler functions for the correlation functions of the velocity and of the displacement. While the velocity thermalizes at large times (slowly, in contrast to the standard Brownian motion case $\delta$ = 1), the displacement never attains equilibrium: it ages. We thus show that this feature of normal diffusion is shared by a subdiffusive or superdiffusive motion.

abstract = {Ubiquitous phenomena exist in nature where, as time goes on, a crossover is observed between different diffusion regimes (e.g., anomalous diffusion at early times which becomes normal diffusion at long times, or the other way around). In order to focus on such situations we have analyzed particular relevant cases of the generalized Fokker-Planck equation [Formula presented] where [Formula presented] and [Formula presented] are kernels to be chosen; the choice [Formula presented] and [Formula presented] recovers the normal diffusion equation. We discuss in detail the following cases: (i) a mixture of the porous medium equation, which is connected with nonextensive statistical mechanics, with the normal diffusion equation; (ii) a mixture of the fractional time derivative and normal diffusion equations; (iii) a mixture of the fractional space derivative, which is related with L{\'{e}}vy flights, and normal diffusion equations. In all three cases a crossover is obtained between anomalous and normal diffusions. In cases (i) and (iii), the less diffusive regime occurs for short times, while at long times the more diffusive regime emerges. The opposite occurs in case (ii). The present results could be easily extended to more complex situations (e.g., crossover between two, or even more, different anomalous regimes), and are expected to be useful in the analysis of phenomena where nonlinear and fractional diffusion equations play an important role. Such appears to be the case for isolated long-ranged interaction Hamiltonians, which along time can exhibit a crossover from a longstanding metastable anomalous state to the usual Boltzmann-Gibbs equilibrium one. Another illustration of such crossover occurs in active intracellular transport. {\textcopyright} 2003 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Random walks (RW) of particles adsorbed in the internal walls of porous deposits produced by ballistic-type growth models are studied. The particles start at the external surface of the deposits and enter their pores in order to simulate an external flux of a species towards a porous solid. For short times, the walker concentration decays as a stretched exponential of the depth z, but a crossover to long-time normal diffusion is observed in most samples. The anomalous concentration profile remains at long times in very porous solids if the walker steps are restricted to nearest neighbors and is accompanied with subdiffusion features. These findings are correlated with a decay of the explored area with z. The study of RW of tracer particles left at the internal part of the solid rules out an interpretation by diffusion equations with position-dependent coefficients. A model of RW in a tube of decreasing cross section explains those results by showing long crossovers from an effective subdiffusion regime to an asymptotic normal diffusion. The crossover position and density are analytically calculated for a tube with area decreasing exponentially with z and show good agreement with numerical data. The anomalous decay of the concentration profile is interpreted as a templating effect of the tube shape on the total number of diffusing particles at each depth, while the volumetric concentration in the actually explored porous region may not have significant decay. These results may explain the anomalous diffusion of metal atoms in porous deposits observed in recent works. They also confirm the difficulty in interpreting experimental or computational data on anomalous transport reported in recent works, particularly if only the concentration profiles are measured. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Understanding large wood (LW; ≥1 m long and ≥10 cm in diameter) dynamics in rivers is critical for many disciplines including those assessing flood hazard and risk. However, our understanding of wood entrainment and deposition is still limited, mainly because of the lack of long-term monitoring of wood-related processes. The dataset presented here was obtained from more than 8 years of monitoring of 1,264 tagged wood pieces placed in 4 low-order streams of the Chilean mountain ranges and was used to further our understanding of key factors controlling LW dynamics. We show that LW displacement lengths were longer during periods when peak-flow water depths (Hmax) exceeded the bankfull stage (HBk) than in periods with Hmax ≤ HBk and that these differences were significantly higher for smaller wood pieces. LW length and length relative to channel dimensions were the main factors governing LW entrainment; LW displacement lengths were inversely related to the ratio of piece length to H15{\%} (i.e., the level above which the flow remains for 15{\%} of the time) and to the ratio of H15{\%} to bankfull width. Unrooted logs and LW pieces located at the bankfull stage travelled significantly longer distances than logs with attached rootwads and those located in other positions within the bankfull channel. A few large logjams were broken during the period of observation, and in all occasions, LW from these broken logjams did not travel over longer distances than other pieces of LW moved in the same periods and in the same stream segments. Most importantly, our work reveals that LW dynamics tend to be concentrated within a few reaches in each stream and that reaches exhibiting high wood dynamics (extensive entrainment, deposition, or repositioning of LW) are significantly wider and less steep than less dynamic reaches.},

abstract = {We analyze the propagation of daily fluctuations in rainfall and potential evapotranspiration to soil moisture dynamics, using a stochastic model that accounts for these two different forms of hydroclimatic variability. The pulsing, intermittent behavior of daily precipitation is described by a compound Poisson process that models the unpredictability of both frequency and amount of rainfall events, while fluctuations in potential evapotranspiration that act continuously in time are assumed to be Gaussian. The resulting model for the soil water balance is thus a stochastic differential equation, forced by a state-dependent compound Poisson noise and a multiplicative Gaussian noise. Steady state probability distribution functions (pdfs) of soil moisture are obtained analytically along with the equations for the expected water balance and its variability. The multiplicative effect of temporal fluctuations in potential evapotranspiration on soil moisture reduces the soil water losses caused by evapotranspiration compared to the case when they are not present. Most importantly, the analysis also shows that because of their different forms and state dependence the impact of rainfall variability on soil moisture dynamics is much more significant than that of potential evapotranspiration, the fluctuations of which do not affect appreciably the soil moisture statistical properties.

The mean level-crossing properties are studied in relation to the different jump amplitudes. As an example of application of the previous theoretical derivations, the role of different rainfall-depth distributions on an existing stochastic soil water balance model is analyzed.

abstract = {It has been observed that the majority of particles in a granular material carries less than the average load and that the number of particles carrying larger than the average load decreases exponentially with increasing contact force. The particles carrying above average load appear to form a strong network of forces while the majority of particles belong to a weak network. The strong network of forces appear to have a spatial characteristic whereby the stronger forces are carried though chainlike particle groups referred to as force chains. There is a strong case for a connection between force chains of the discrete medium and the trajectory of the most compressive principal stress in its continuous idealization. While such properties seem obvious from descriptive analysis of physical and numerical experiments in granular media, progress in quantification of the force chain statistics requires an objective description of what constitutes a force chain. A procedure to quantify the occurrence of force chains is built on a proposed definition having two parts: first, the chain is a quasilinear arrangement of three or more particles, and second, along the chain, stress concentration within each grain is characterized by the vector delineating the most compressive principal stress. The procedure is incorporated into an algorithm that can be applied to large particle assemblies to compile force chain statistics. The procedure is demonstrated on a discrete element simulation of a rigid punch into a half space. It was found that only approximately half of the particles within the group of so-called strong network particles are part of force chains. Throughout deformation, the average length of force chains varied slightly but the number of force chains decreased as the punch advanced. The force chain lengths follow an exponential distribution. The procedure provides a tool for objective analysis of force chains, although future work is required to incorporate branching of force chains into the analysis. {\textcopyright} 2005 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Field measurements of sediment transport in gravel bed rivers often reveal hysteretic effects due to differences in sediment availability between the rising and falling limbs of a flood hydrograph. However, only a small number of flume studies have analyzed the dynamics of sediment transport during hydrographs. Three types of stepped hydrographs with contrasting durations and magnitudes are simulated here under sediment recirculation conditions. Bed load transport rate and grain size have been measured continuously. The dynamic behavior of the surface armor layer has been explored by analyzing digital photographs and laser scanner surveys of the bed surface taken during hydrographs. The results indicate that sediment transport during the falling limb was lower than during the rising limb in all of the three types of hydrographs. This reduction is more evident for the low-magnitude hydrographs. The grain size of the bed remained virtually constant throughout the hydrographs but the grain size of transported sediments exhibited a counterclockwise hysteresis. Also, a significant increase in the reference shear stress for sediment entrainment was measured during the falling limb of hydrographs. Additionally, a detailed analysis of partial transport dynamics of the bed surface sediments reveals a reduction in sediment mobility during the falling limb of the hydrographs. The difference in sediment entrainment and transport before and after the peak of the hydrographs appears to be caused by a change in the organization of the surface sediments. An analysis of detailed laser scan bed surveys reveals a phase of bed restructuring (lower vertical roughness, clast rearrangement) during the falling limb of hydrographs. Consequently, changes in the degree of organization and complexity of the bed surface are likely the cause of the reduced mobility of sediments, and thus of the reduced sediment transport rate, during the falling limb of the hydrographs. {\textcopyright} 2012.

Both closed-pore and open-pore systems are discussed. The Poisson grain model, the model of hard spheres packing, and the penetrable sphere model are used; variable size distribution of the pores is included. A parameter is introduced which controls the degree of open-porosity. Besides systems built up by a single solid phase, models for porous media with the internal surface coated by a second phase are treated. Volume fraction, surface area, and correlation functions are given explicitly where applicable; otherwise numerical methods for determination are described. Effective medium theory is applied to calculate physical properties for the models such as isotropic elastic moduli, thermal and electrical conductivity, and static dielectric constant. The methods presented are exemplified by applications: small-angle scattering of systems showing fractal-like behavior in limited ranges of linear dimension, optimization of nanoporous insulating materials, and improvement of properties of open-pore systems by atomic layer deposition of a second phase on the internal surface. {\textcopyright} 2014 Helmut Hermann and Antje Elsner.},

abstract = {We present analytical expressions for the time-dependent and stationary probability distributions corresponding to a stochastically perturbed one-dimensional flow with critical points, in two physically relevant situations: delayed evolution, in which the flow alternates with a quiescent state in which the dynamical variable remains frozen at its current value for random intervals of time; and interrupted evolution, in which the variable is also reset in the quiescent state to a random value drawn from a fixed distribution. In the former case, the effect of the delay upon the first passage time statistics is analyzed. In the latter case, the conditions under which an extended stationary distribution can exist as a consequence of the competition between an attractor in the flow and the random resetting are examined. We elucidate the role of the normalization condition in eliminating the singularities arising from the unstable critical points of the flow, and present a number of representative examples. A simple formula is obtained for the stationary distribution and interpreted physically. A similar interpretation is also given for the known formula for the stationary distribution in a full-fledged dichotomous flow.},

abstract = {Sediment transport is an intrinsically stochastic process, and measurement of bed load in the environment is further complicated by the unsteady nature of river flooding. Here we present a methodology for analyzing sediment tracer data with unsteady forcing. We define a dimensionless impulse by integrating the cumulative excess shear velocity for the duration of measurement, normalized by grain size. We analyze the dispersion of a plume of cobble tracers in a very flashy stream over two years. The mean and variance of transport distance collapse onto well-defined linear and power-law relations, respectively, when plotted against cumulative dimensionless impulse. Data suggest that the asymptotic limit of bed load tracer dispersion is superdiffusive, in line with a broad class of geophysical flows exhibiting strong directional asymmetry (advection), thin-tailed step lengths and heavy-tailed waiting times. The impulse framework justifies the use of quasi-steady flow approximations for long-term river evolution modeling. Key Points Variability in hydrographs can be quantified using the dimensionless impulse. Sediment tracers display thin-tailed steps and heavy tailed waiting times. Sediment transport should be modeled as an asymmetric random walk. {\textcopyright}2013. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract = {Vertical sediment exchange is a fundamental component of bedload transport in gravel-bed channels. This paper describes the characteristic depth of exchange achieved over a long flood series. Analysis is based on 11 recoveries of magnetically tagged gravels deployed in Carnation Creek, Canada, completed between 1990 and 2008. Vertical grain exchange mixes gravels throughout the streambed relatively rapidly. Within one to eight floods the mean burial depth approaches two times the surface layer thickness, quantified by the 90th percentile of the size distribution. Finer gravels are mixed more rapidly into the bed than coarser gravels. Both active and passive grain exchanges throughout most of the bed produce the overall vertical distribution of marked grains. Gravel exchanges exhibit fairly consistent patterns once tracers are well mixed by large floods. Results highlight the role of flood sequence in determining exchange depths, support the notion of an upper limit to exchange, and underscore the importance of passive grain exchange. {\textcopyright} 2011 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

At reach and at watershed scales, mass movement and bank erosion dominated inputs, and fluvial transport was an important flux term in several reaches. Large wood recruitment by mortality was relatively minor in comparison. Large proportions of the in-channel LW were stored in jams with a mean age of 40-50 years. Overall, both modeling approaches yielded reasonable stored LW predictions in the study creeks, with the omission/inclusion of transport responsible for the largest differences between models. Modeled storage generally was within 30{\%} of that measured in the field, and our results illustrate the large temporal variation in storage resulting from episodic inputs of LW from hillslopes.},

abstract = {In small and intermediate sized streams, the interaction between wood and bed material transport often determines the nature of the physical habitat, which in turn influences the health of the stream's ecosystem. We present a stochastic model that can be used to simulate the effects on physical habitat of forest fires, climate change, and other environmental disturbances that alter wood recruitment. The model predicts large wood (LW) loads in a stream as well as the volume of sediment stored by the wood; while it is parameterized to describe gravel bed streams similar to a well-studied field prototype, Fishtrap Creek, British Columbia, it can be calibrated to other systems as well. In the model, LW pieces are produced and modified over time as a result of random tree-fall, LW breakage, LW movement, and piece interaction to form LW jams. Each LW piece traps a portion of the annual bed material transport entering the reach and releases the stored sediment when the LW piece is entrained and moved. The equations governing sediment storage are based on a set of flume experiments also scaled to the field prototype. The model predicts wood loads ranging from 70 m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}/ha to more than 300 m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}/ha, with a mean value of 178 m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}/ha: both the range and the mean value are consistent with field data from streams with similar riparian forest types and climate. The model also predicts an LW jam spacing that is consistent with field data. Furthermore, our modeling Results demonstrate that the high spatial and temporal variability in sediment storage, sediment transport, and channel morphology associated with LW-dominated streams occurs only when LW pieces interact and form jams. Model runs that do not include jam formation are much less variable. These Results suggest that river restoration efforts using engineered LW pieces that are fixed in place and not permitted to interact will be less successful at restoring the geomorphic processes responsible for producing diverse, productive physical habitats than efforts using LW pieces that are free to move, interact, and form LW jams. {\textcopyright} 2012.

While nearly every book mentions the Poisson process, most hurry past to more general point processes or to Markov chains. This comparative neglect is ill judged, and stems from a lack of perception of the real importance of the Poisson process. This distortion partly comes about from a restriction to one dimension, while the theory becomes more natural in more general contexts. This book attempts to redress the balance. It records the author's fascination with the beauty and wide applicability of Poisson processes in one or more dimensions. The mathematical theory is powerful and a few key results often produce surprising consequences.},

The 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake in central Taiwan generated thousands of landslides along the middle reach of the Peikang River. Sediment from these landslides produced widespread aggradation, such that much of the river's bed remains shielded from active bedrock incision. We present data that constrain the spatial and temporal variability of sediment cover for the Peikang River. Because the river is undergoing spatially variable Holocene bedrock incision (1-10 mm/yr), it offers a unique natural experiment to test the influence of intermittent sedimentation on long-term incision rates. Published electrical resistivity surveys at seven locations along the river reveal median sediment depth values ranging from 1.9 to 11.5 m. The sediment depth correlates inversely with long-term incision rate and sediment transport capacity. We interpret this as an indication that the frequency of bedrock exposure exerts a major influence on incision along the Peikang River.

abstract = {When a ball moves through the air, the air exerts a force on the ball. For a sphere moving at constant velocity with respect to the air, this force is called the drag force and it has been well measured. If the sphere moves with a nonconstant velocity there are additional forces. These “unsteady” forces depend on the sphere's acceleration and, in principle, also on higher derivatives of the motion. The force equal to a constant times the acceleration is called the “added mass” because it increases the effective inertia of the sphere moving through the fluid. We measure the unsteady forces on a sphere by observing the one- and two-dimensional projectile motion of light spheres around the highest point. The one-dimensional motion is well described by just the usual buoyant force and the added mass as calculated in the ideal fluid model. This measurement is an excellent experiment for introductory physics students. For spheres in two-dimensional projectile motion the downward vertical acceleration at the highest point increases with the horizontal velocity. This effect can be described by an additional force proportional to the speed times the acceleration.},

Because they account for temporal aspects of the applied hydrodynamic forces, impulse-based or energy-based approaches provide a better representation of a highly fluctuating phenomenon compared to the more traditional time-averaged Shields parameter or constant force magnitude-based model. In the present paper, we elaborate further on the simulation of particle migration by applying a theoretical model based on hydrodynamic pressure data. Three common movement scenarios and the dynamic critical drag force, allowed to vary during particle motion, are qualitatively discussed here. Also, the possible inaccuracy in entrainment prediction of three different models is addressed with reference to our simulation results.

abstract = {Introduction: The prevalence of invasive pneumococcal disease, which is depending on risk factors and comorbidities, is increasing over the age of 50 years. Most developed countries have recommendations but vaccination rates remain low. Aim: To assess the general practitioners' daily practice in relation to pneumococcal vaccination and analyse the effect of informing the subjects about the importance of pneumococcal vaccination on vaccination routine. Method: Subjects over 50 years of age vaccinated against influenza during the 2012/2013 campaign were informed about the importance of pneumococcal vaccination and asked to fill in a questionnaire. Results: Of the 4000 subjects, 576 asked for a prescription of pneumococcal vaccine (16.5{\%} of females and 11.6{\%} of males, OR 1.67 CI 95{\%} 1.37-2.04, p{\textless}0.001) and 310 were vaccinated. The mean age of females and males was 70.95 and 69.8 years, respectively (OR 1.01; CI 95{\%} 1.00-1.02; p{\textless}0.05). Information given by physicians resulted in 33,6{\%} prescription rate, while in case it was 8{\%} when nurses provided information (OR 6.33; CI 95{\%} 5.23-7.67; p{\textless}0.001). As an effect of this study the vaccination rate was 6.3 times higher than in the previous year campaign (p{\textless}0.001). Conclusions: General practitioners are more effective in informing subjects about the importance of vaccination than nurses. Campaign can raise the vaccination rate significantly.},

abstract = {A descriptive model for bed material routing in small sand and gravel bedded channels with sequences of pools and armoured riffles was developed. Aspects of the model are demonstrated at Flynn Creek, a 202‐ha, third‐order drainage in the Oregon Coast Range. Assuming that channel geometry, sediment transport competence, and the availability of sediments for transport are all non‐uniform in the downstream direction, the model described bedload transport as occurring in two phases. Phase I involves the transport of fine, predominantly sand‐sized bed materials over stable gravel‐armoured riffles. Phase II occurs at higher flows that can entrain riffle armour and transport riffle sediments, in addition to Phase I sediments. Phase I bedload transport was sampled during three moderate flow events. A power function related Phase I bedload transport to water discharge. The relationship was consistent between storms and between two successive years. Phase II bedload transport, sampled during a 1.8‐yr return period streamflow event in February, 1979, proved non‐uniform in a downstream direction and unsteady over time at a given stream discharge. Transport rates closely correlated with the rapid scour and redeposition of the riffle at the bedload sampling cross‐section; transport peaks corresponded to scour and transport decreased greatly during deposition. The transport of large ({\textgreater} 12.5 mm diam.) bed material increased up to 12‐fold during riffle scour. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1982 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd},

abstract = {Mathematical models of geomorphic processes can have value as both predictive tools and precise conceptual frameworks. Well-posed mechanistic models have great conceptual value because they link geomorphic processes to universal scientific principles, such as conservation of energy, momentum, and mass. Models without this linkage (e.g., models based exclusively on cellular rules or empirical correlations) have less conceptual value but offer logical methodology for making practical predictions in some circumstances. Clear tests of the predictive power of mechanistic models can be achieved in controlled experiments, whereas natural landscapes typically have uncontrolled initial and boundary conditions and unresolved geological heterogeneities that preclude decisive tests. The best mechanistic models have a simplicity that results from minimizing assumptions and postulates, rather than minimizing mathematics, and this simplicity promotes conclusive tests. Optimal models also employ only parameters that are defined and measured outside the model context. Common weaknesses in geomorphic models result from use of freely coined equations without clear links to conservation laws or compelling data, use of fitted rather than measured values of parameters, lack of clear distinction between assumptions and approximations, and neglect of the four-dimensional (space + time) nature of most geomorphic processes. Models for predicting landslide runout illustrate principles and pitfalls that are common to all geomorphic modeling.},

To accommodate the temporal variation in bed shear stress, the model includes a stochastic element based on the characteristics of turbulence derived from the flume evidence of McQuivey (1973a, b). In terms of the Shields parameter, results show reasonable agreement with the range of observations quoted from the field and with the experimental data of Fenton and Abbott (1977).

abstract = {We use the erosion-deposition model introduced by Charru et al. (2004) to numerically simulate the evolution of a plume of bed load tracers entrained by a steady flow. In this model, the propagation of the plume results from the stochastic exchange of particles between the bed and the bed load layer. We find a transition between two asymptotic regimes. The tracers, initially at rest, are gradually set into motion by the flow. During this entrainment regime, the plume is strongly skewed in the direction of propagation and continuously accelerates while spreading nonlinearly. With time, the skewness of the plume eventually reaches a maximum value before decreasing. This marks the transition to an advection-diffusion regime in which the plume becomes increasingly symmetrical, spreads linearly, and advances at constant velocity. We analytically derive the expressions of the position, the variance, and the skewness of the plume and investigate their asymptotic regimes. Our model assumes steady state. In the field, however, bed load transport is intermittent. We show that the asymptotic regimes become insensitive to this intermittency when expressed in terms of the distance traveled by the plume. If this finding applies to the field, it might provide an estimate for the average bed load transport rate.},

abstract = {An attempt has been made to describe, based solely on field data , bedload relations for natural, paved gravel-bed streams. Data gathered from Oak Creek, Oregon were used to study the size distribution of bedload in paved gravel-bed streams. Similarity analysis suggests that once the pavement is broken, essentially all sizes are rendered of roughly equal mobility. This implies that for poorly-graded gravels only one grain size is required to characterize total bedload as a function of Shields stress, and that not much extra accuracy can be gained by calculating the bedload for each size range separately and summing. It also suggests that the bedload size distribution should approximate that of the pavement. The first implication was used to develop a simple means of predicting total bedload in gravel bed streams in conjunction with data from Oak Creek, the Elbow River, and other streams. The method approximates accuracy for streams with moderate to steep slopes that are not dominated by sand throughput load. The second implication would appear to apply in terms of annual sediment yield form gravel-bed streams that are not dominated by throughput load. A reanalysis of the Oak Creek data reveals that higher flows favor coarser bedload material. As concerns the relation of Meyer-Peter and Muller, its performance regarding the field data presented in this study is poor. There also appears to be no way to adjust the relation in terms of an effective grain size to bring it into accord with the data. Thus, it is not recommended. (Baker-FRC)},

abstract = {A continuous record reveals that the incidence of bedload in a coarse‐grained river channel changes from flood to flood. Long periods of inactivity encourage the channel bed to consolidate sufficiently so that bedload is largely confined to the recession limb of the next flood‐wave. But when floods follow each other closely, the bed material is comparatively loose and offers less resistance to entrainment. In this case, substantial amounts of bedload are generated on the rising limb. This is confirmed by values of bed shear stress or stream power at the threshold of initial motion which can be up to five times the overall mean in the case of isolated floods or those which are the first of the season. This produces a complicated relationship between flow parameters and bedload and explains some of the difficulties in establishing bedload rating curves for coarse‐grained channels. Besides this, the threshold of initial motion is shown to occur at levels of bed shear stress three times those at the thresholds of final motion. This adds further confusion to attempts at developing predictive bedload equations and clearly indicates at least one reason why equations currently in use are unsatisfactory. Bedload is shown to be characterized by a series of pulses with a mean periodicity of 1.7 hours. In the absence of migrating bedforms, it is speculated that this well‐documented pattern reflects the passage of kinematic waves of particles in a slow‐moving traction carpet. The general pattern of bedload, including pulsations, is shown to occur more or less synchronously at different points across the stream channel.

A turbulence-resolving flow model downstream of a backward-facing step, coupled with a model integrating the equations of motion of individual sand grains, is used to investigate the physical interaction between bed load motion and turbulence downstream of separated flow. Large bed load transport events are found to correspond to low-frequency positive pressure fluctuations. Episodic penetration of fluid into the bed increases the bed stress and moves grains. Fluid penetration events are larger in magnitude near the point of reattachment than farther downstream. Models of bed load transport over ripples and dunes must incorporate the effects of these penetration events of high stress and sediment flux.},

abstract = {This paper reports a radiofrequency identification (RFID) tracing experiment implemented in a high-sediment-load mountain stream typical of alpine gravel-bed torrents. The study site is the Bouinenc Torrent, a tributary to the Bl{\'{e}}one River in southeast France that drains a 38{\textperiodcentered}9-km 2 degraded catchment. In spring 2008, we deployed 451 tracers with b-axis ranging from 23 to 520 mm. Tracers were seeded along eight cross-sections located in the upstream part of the lowest 2{\textperiodcentered}3 km of the stream. Three tracer inventories were implemented in July 2008, 2009 and 2010. Recovery rates calculated for mobile tracers declined from 78{\%} in 2008 to 45{\%} in 2009 and 25{\%} in 2010. Observations of tracer displacement revealed very high sediment dispersion, with frontrunners having travelled more than 2 km only three months after their deployment. The declining recovery rate over time was interpreted as resulting from rapid dispersion rather than deep burial. We evaluated that 64{\%} of the tracers deployed in the active channel were exported from the 2{\textperiodcentered}3-km study reach three years after the onset of the tracing experiment. Travel distances were characterized by right-skewed and heavy-tailed distributions, correctly fitted by a power-law function. This supports the idea that in gravel-bed rivers with abundant sediment supply relative to transport capacity, bedload transport can be viewed as a superdiffusive sediment dispersion process. It is also shown that tracers initially deployed in the low-flow channel were characterized by a 15- to 30-fold increase of mobility compared to tracers deployed in gravel bars. {\textcopyright} 2011 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Bed load transport formulae have not been tested extensively over medium spatial and temporal scales. The lack of such testing is undoubtedly due to a paucity of field data available for testing at these scales. Extensive transport, morphologic, and discharge data, available for a 10-year period along an 8-km study reach of the Vedder River, British Columbia, are used to test the predictive capabilities of bed load transport formulae at medium scales. The transport data were obtained using the morphologic approach, which is based on the premise that changes in channel morphology reflect the transfer of sediment. Such transport estimates can be made over larger spatial and temporal scales than is possible using traditional measurement techniques. This study focuses on evaluating the original and revised versions of the Bagnold stream power formula, the Meyer-Peter and Muller formula and a stream power correlation. Overall, the formulae are found to underpredict gravel transport rates for the Vedder River. The discrepancy is particularly pronounced in 1982-1983 and 1987-1990, which are periods during which significant dredging occurred. Dredging activity may have loosened the bed structure or resulted in a disequilibrium morphology, thereby increasing sediment movement. Analysis is undertaken to assess how the use of mean daily discharge vs. 15-min increment discharge series affects transport predictions. Results show that only the Meyer-Peter and Muller formula is particularly sensitive to which discharge series is used in calculations. Modification of the Shields parameter is found to significantly affect transport predictions, although it cannot explain alone the discrepancies between field data and calculated results. Predictions of total deposition in the study reach are well within an order-of-magnitude for all equations. The Bagnold-type formulae and the Meyer-Peter and Muller formula do not capture the relatively even distribution of deposition along the study reach. Surprisingly, the simple stream power correlation captured this downstream pattern of deposition. Cumulative distributions of predicted bed load transport are found to be most realistic for the original and revised Bagnold formulae. Results of this study do not suggest that one particular formula is consistently preferred. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Sediment-laden flows are a complex solid-fluid interaction process. This study presents a multimode morphodynamic model system combined with shallow water theory and a nonequilibrium assumption for sediment transport. The model system aims to simulate the morphological change caused by sediment-laden flows with various sediment transport modes. It involves three modules: a hydrodynamic module, a sediment transport module, and a morphological evolution module. The hydrodynamic model is governed by modified shallow water equations considering the interaction effects of flow and sediment. A flexible sediment transport model is presented that incorporates a weight coefficient. The model can adaptively choose an appropriate transport mode according to local, real-time flow conditions. Bedload, suspended load, and total mixed sediment load are all involved. The model is solved by a second-order Godunov-type finite-volume method that is robust and accurate. Validation is demonstrated through a series of test cases. The results indicate that the model can attain good agreement with measured data, thereby demonstrating the capabilities of the multimode morphodynamic model system in predicting sediment-laden flows and resulting morphological change.},

abstract = {The last two decades have witnessed the development and application of well-balanced numerical models for shallow flows in natural rivers. However, until now there have been no such models for flows with non-uniform sediment transport. This paper presents a 1D well-balanced model to simulate flows and non-capacity transport of non-uniform sediment in alluvial rivers. The active layer formulation is adopted to resolve the change of bed sediment composition. In the framework of the finite volume Slope LImiter Centred (SLIC) scheme, a surface gradient method is incorporated to attain well-balanced solutions to the governing equations. The proposed model is tested against typical cases with irregular topography, including the refilling of dredged trenches, aggradation due to sediment overloading and flood flow due to landslide dam failure. The agreement between the computed results and measured data is encouraging. Compared to a non-well-balanced model, the well-balanced model features improved performance in reproducing stage, velocity and bed deformation. It should find general applications for non-uniform sediment transport modelling in alluvial rivers, especially in mountain areas where the bed topography is mostly irregular.},

abstract = {A fully divergence-free method is proposed for generation of inhomogeneous/anisotropic turbulence with large spatial variation. The method is based on the method of Smirnov et al., which is known to violate the divergence-free constraint when spatial variation of turbulence is present. In the proposed method a vector potential field is introduced; by taking the vector curl of the potential field one can generate a strictly divergence-free flow field. A novel formulation for scaling the vector potential field, together with a coordinate transformation strategy, is proposed in this work. The result is a six-step procedure for the generation of inhomogeneous turbulence fields. The proposed formulation is proven to reproduce the prescribed velocity correlation with energy spectrum at large Reynolds numbers. Four test cases are considered to evaluate the new method. First, the statistical quantities introduced in the proposed method are verified numerically in a classical homogeneous turbulence case. Then, the performance of the new method is demonstrated in three different inhomogeneous turbulence cases: a confined turbulent flow in a "slip-wall" box, a planar channel flow and an annular flow. It is shown that the unphysical patterns in the fluctuation fields and divergence errors produced with Smirnov?s method are absent in the results from the new method. The accuracy of the proposed methods is verified by comparing the velocity correlations with the prescribed scaling functions. The proposed method is efficient and simple to implement. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{KOMAR1991,
abstract = {Flow‐competence assessments of floods have been based on the largest particle sizes transported, and yield either the mean flow stress, mean velocity, or discharge per unit flow width. The use of extreme particle sizes has potential problems in that they may have been transported by debris flows rather than by the flood, it may be difficult to locate the largest particles within the flood deposits, and there are questions concerning how representative one or a few large particles might be of the transported sediments and therefore of the flood hydraulics. Such problems would be eliminated for the most part if competence evaluations are based on median grain sizes of transported sediments, or perhaps on some coarse percentile that is established by a reasonable number of grains. In order to examine such issues, the gravel‐transport data of Milhous from Oak Creek, Oregon, and of Carling from Great Eggleshope Beck, England, have been analysed in terms of changing grain‐size percentiles with varying flow stresses. A comparison between these two data sets is of added interest because the bed material in Oak Creek is segregated into well‐developed pavement and subpavement layers, while such a layering of bed materials is largely absent in Great Eggleshope Beck. The analyses show that the trend of increasing sizes of the largest particles in the bedload samples (diameter Dm) with increasing flow stresses is consistent with similar dependencies based on sieve percentiles ranging from the medians (D50) to the 95th percentiles (D95). This indicates that the largest particles are an integral part of the overall distributions of bedload grain sizes, and respond to changing flow hydraulics along with the rest of the size distribution. In Oak Creek, the median grain size shows the largest change with increasing flow stresses, followed by D60, and so on to D95 which shows the smallest change. The variations in Dm continue this trend, and are similar to those for D95. This systematic variation of grain‐size percentiles in Oak Creek is consistent with changes in the overall distributions which tend to be symmetrical and Gaussian for low discharges, but become skewed Rosin distributions for high discharges. In contrast, in Great Eggleshope Beck the several percentiles and Dm show the same rate of shift to coarser sizes as flow stresses increase. This results in part from differences in sampling techniques wherein the bedload samples from Great Eggleshope Beck represent a complete flood event, while shorterterm samples at a specific flow stage were obtained in Oak Creek. As a result of the integrated sampling in Great Eggleshope Beck, the bedload grain‐size distributions are more complex, commonly with a bimodal pattern. However, after accounting for differences in sampling schemes in the two streams, contrasting patterns in changing grain‐size distributions remain, and these are concluded to reflect grain sorting differences as the bedload grain‐size distributions approach the distributions of the bed materials. It is surprising that if criteria commonly employed to demonstrate the equal mobility of different grain sizes are used in the comparison, then Great Eggleshope Beck is far closer to this condition in spite of its minimal development of a pavement. It is concluded that the respective shapes of the bed‐material grain‐size distributions, in particular their degrees of skewness, are more important to the observed sorting patterns than are the effects of a pavement layer regulating grain entrapment to produce an equal mobility of different grain sizes. Therefore, the comparison has established that flow‐competence relationships will differ from one stream to another, depending on the pattern of grain sorting which is a function of the bedmaterial grain‐size distribution.

All reservoirs are subjected to sedimentation which, without adequate prevention and mitigation counter-measures, threatens their sustainability. As well as the evident loss of storage capacity, the adequate and safe operation of water intakes and bottom outlets belonging to the vital outlet structures can be affected by the deposition of sediments in the reservoir. This Vision Paper first addresses the state-of-the-art and the main scientific advances in terms of prevention and mitigation measures against sedimentation in reservoirs. Then, the main research challenges, which result from the assessment of what are the remaining open questions, are pointed out.

Understanding the performance and limitations of the PIV method under these conditions is critical for optimising experimental parameters and robust interpretation of data. The optimum algorithm for extracting velocity fields from PIV images is the subject of ongoing revision with the goal of maximising resolution and minimising errors, and recent advances in this regard may be particularly beneficial for open-channel turbulence research. Key steps in the iterative discrete shift (IDS) and image deformation method (IDM) algorithms are detailed, and the fundamental differences between direct cross correlation and FFT-based correlation methods are explained. It is also shown how the resolution of an algorithm can be determined from its modulation transfer function (MTF), and how the MTF can be manipulated with the selection of intensity weighting windows.

The bed slope decreased with increasing sand supply, indicating that the gravel could be transported at the same rate, along with increasing amounts of sand, at smaller shear stresses. Prediction of river response to an increase in sediment supply requires prediction of mutual changes in bed composition and transport, and therefore a transport model defined in terms of the grain size of the bed surface. A recent model provides satisfactory prediction of the experimental observations and indicates the general response of gravel beds to increased sand supply. An increase in sand supply may increase the sand content of the river bed and the mobility of gravel fractions, which can lead to bed degradation and preferential evacuation of these sediments from the river.

abstract = {We report on bedtoad transport observations using piezoelectric bedload impact sensors (PBIS), an indirect method of estimating the volume of bedload transport of coarse sediment The PBIS device registers vibrations produced by bedtoad (particle diameter {\textgreater}-20 mm) and records the signal as a sum of the number of impulses per time. Sediment transport at the Erlenbach stream has been continuously monitored with a PBIS array starting in 1986. The sensor array spans the width of an entire cross-section and is mounted flush with the surface of a check dam immediately upstream of a sediment retention basin. We compare PBIS data with long-term sedimentation records obtained from repeated surveys of material stored in the sediment retention basin, with artificial sediment input under controlled conditions in the field, and also with laboratory experiments. The rate of bedload transport is proportional to the number of impacts on the sensor per unit time. The reliability of the calibration relationship increases with the length of the observation period, e.g. for higher numbers of impacts and larger bedload volumes. Sediment volumes for individual flood events estimated with the PBIS method are in agreement with volumes estimated using an independent empirical method based on the effective runoff volume of water, the peak water discharge, and the critical discharge for the onset of sediment transport.

abstract = {Frequently, an assessment of the mean water velocity in a stream is necessary to estimate the discharge associated with a particular flow depth or, conversely, the mean depth associated with a particular discharge. In the absence of a direct measurement of flow velocity, a flow resistance approach, which establishes the relation between depth and velocity, can be applied. Two approaches have been used in the past: traditional approaches based on the use of a resistance coefficient (e.g., Darcy-Weisbach) or dimensionless hydraulic geometry approaches. To examine if one approach is more appropriate for steep streams, data from 31 flume experiments conducted to examine flow resistance in self-formed cascade channels were analyzed. A dimensionless hydraulic geometry approach developed using at-a-station data to characterize the q* exponent and between-site data to characterize the exponent on the channel slope term was more accurate than more traditional approaches. The developed relation was similar to the established rational relation (v $\alpha$ g0.2q 0.6s-0.4S0.2), suggesting that the rational relation has merit. The approach does not utilize a flow partitioning approach since, in steep streams with small relative depths, the grains themselves generate form and spill resistance. The observation that a single dimensionless hydraulic geometry flow resistance relation can describe measurements across a range of grain sizes and bed slopes (3-21{\%}) suggests that steep streams may follow a single scaling relation similar to the regime equations associated with lowland rivers.

Two water recirculating sediment feed flumes were used: one with a 6 m long and 0.15 m wide channel and other with an 11 m long channel with widths of 0.74 m and 0.53 m. The sediment, poorly sorted gravel with a mean size of 3 mm, was fed at the upstream end of the channel at steady rates from 0.03 kg s−1 m−1 to 1.0 kg s−1 m−1. Sediment transport rate out of the channel varied in all runs, at approximate periods of 3 min in the runs with high transport rates to 14 min in the runs with low transport rates. The runs with low transport rates also showed fluctuations in total transport rate at periods of about 25 min. Transport rates of each size fraction varied with time in a distinctive pattern in all runs. The time variations were caused by the migration of very long and low bed load sheets in the runs with low to moderate transport rates and dunelike bed forms in the run with the highest transport rate. The bed surface in all runs was coarser in size than the original sediment mix except that with the highest transport rate (run H5) in which the size distribution was nearly the same as the original.

Sandy bed forms all had identical initial geometries; however, the initial distance between bed form crests was varied between experiments. Overall deformation of the bed varied as a function of initial bed form spacing; however, bed forms evolved unpredictably as periods of relatively slow change were punctuated by periods of rapidly changing geometry. Subtle changes in bed form trough geometry were found to have a strong influence on turbulence and therefore sediment transport.

abstract = {Bed conditions (micro‐relief, textural associations and packing structural arrangements) in the gravel‐bed channel of Seale's Brook are shown to be closely interrelated; various categories are identified and related to mode of bed material transport and deposition. Entrainment of bed material, commonly treated as a simple function of particle weight and channel hydraulics, is also shown to be strongly affected by varying and variable bed conditions. In particular, the classic concept of competence appears to be of restricted utility in such channels; resistance of bed material to fluid drag and to particle impact is augmented, over large parts of the channel bed, by its interlocking structure, made possible by the wide range in particle calibre, and by the characteristic disc and blade shapes of the slate debris. Particle mobility, as indicated by distance of travel of labelled bed material, is only partly a function of particle weight; indeed, although particle mobility decreases from small pebbles to large cobbles, it also decreases for the finest bed material (very small pebbles). This appears to be explicable, partly in terms of the ease of entrainment (and duration of travel), and, partly in relation to the ease of transport of material over an uneven channel bed surface. Particle mobility is greatest for material in open and infilled structures and smallest for sediment in tight structural arrangements. Local bed slope also exerts an influence on the probability of particle entrainment and on particle mobility. The findings emphasize the need for combining sedimentological and engineering approaches to bed material transport in coarse‐bedded channels, and, at the same time, illustrate some of the reasons for the existence of indeterminacy in the modelling of bed‐material transporting processes.

abstract = {A 14‐month continuous record of the spatial variation in the incidence and magnitude of bed load transport was provided by nine pit traps sunk into the bed of a 21‐m‐wide upland gravel bed river. The bed load data are related to a simultaneous record of average bed shear stress derived from the depth‐slope product. The study reach is straight and includes a small, low‐relief mid‐channel bar which represents the divide between two zones of markedly different bed structure and stability. he bed of the left channel and bar tail is loose with an open framework, while that of the bar head and right channel is tightly interlocking and well imbricated. Bed surface grain size is similar throughout the reach. The two zones of contrasting bed structure have a strong influence on the threshold of sediment movement ($\tau$c) and consequently the spatial pattern of bed load transport. Entrainment thresholds for the tightly structured bed are up to seven times higher than those for the loosely structured bed. Sediment transport is therefore most frequent in the left channel and over the bar tail, where flows with excess shear stresses ($\tau$ {\textgreater} $\tau$c) peaking at 8$\tau$c constitute 19{\%} of the flow record. This is in marked contrast to the right channel and bar head, where excess shear stresses of maximum 1.4$\tau$c total only 1.3{\%} of the flow record. However, despite the marked difference in the magnitude and duration of competent flows between the two contrasting bed areas, little difference in bed load yield is observed between the nine traps when averaged over the 14‐month study period. This study shows that different zones of bed structure and stability in a channel will control the incidence and spatial pattern of bed load transport but not necessarily the medium and long‐term bed load yield. This has important implications for local and short‐term bed load sampling programs and the numerical modeling of sediment budgets and zone‐to‐zone bed load transfer.

abstract = {Fractional transport rates, bed surface texture, and bed configuration were measured after a mixed size sediment had reached an equilibrium transport state for seven different flow strengths in a recirculating laboratory flume. Fractional transport rates were also measured at the beginning of each run when the bed was well mixed and planar. The start‐up observations allow us to describe the variation of fractional transport rates with bed shear stress for a constant bed surface texture and bed configuration. The start‐up and equilibrium observations together allow, for the first time, an unambiguous description of the mutual adjustment among the transport, the bed configuration, and the bed surface, as the transport system moves toward equilibrium. We find that a substantial interaction exists among the transport, bed surface, and bed configuration. Bed forms and a coarse surface layer coexist over a range of bed shear stress. Under some flow conditions the size and shape of the bed forms are controlled by the presence of the coarse surface layer. At higher flows the coarse surface layer is eliminated by scour in the lee of the bed forms. If the bed surface is defined as that over which the bed forms move, a coherent relation between the bed surface texture and the transport grain size distribution may be defined. At equilibrium the transport rates of all fractions were not equally mobile, defined as identical transport and bed grain size distributions, although equal mobility was approached for runs in which the bed shear stress was more than twice that for initial motion of the mixture. Under some flow conditions the transport was observed to adjust away from equal mobility as the bed adjusted from a well‐mixed start‐up condition to an equilibrium state. Development of a partial static armor, wherein some individual grains become essentially immobile even though other grains in the same fraction remain in transport, is suggested to explain these adjustments between the transport and bed surface grain size distributions. Constraints on equilibrium mixed size sediment transport are defined. The special conditions for which equal mobility must hold and the relevance to natural conditions of flume results and the equal mobility concept are discussed.

abstract = {The concept of critical stress for the initial motion of noncohesive sediment beds under turbulent flow conditions is reviewed. Observational definitions of incipient motion are many and not entirely compatible. Some laboratory flume observations of sediment movement suggest that no true threshold exists. Current understanding of turbulent fluid motion at a sediment bed suggests that some particle movement must occur at all nonzero time-mean velocities. A combined model for flume flow and sediment transport having no threshold is seen to explain features of data that have been previously used to support the threshold concept. {\textcopyright} ASCE.},

abstract = {An estimate of apparent bedload velocity ($\nu$) can be derived from the difference between Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) and acoustic Doppler current profiler (aDcp) bottom track (BT) measurements when BT is biased by moving bottom. A Kalman filter has been developed to integrate GPS and bottom track data to improve estimation of boat velocity during ADCP measurements under moving bed conditions. The boat velocity estimated using the Kalman filter is superior to boat velocity from raw DGPS data. In this paper we assess the improvement in estimation of $\nu$ using the Kalman filter as opposed to raw DGPS data. Specifically, a synthetic moving bed bias was generated. The synthetic moving bed bias had mean, variance, and distribution across the section as typically observed during bedload transport conditions, and had the advantage that it was known explicitly. The errors in estimated apparent bedload velocity derived using either raw DGPS data or the Kalman filter boat velocity were compared. It was found that the improved boat velocity from the Kalman filter yielded significantly (alpha=0.05) better estimates of $\nu$, because boat velocity errors were reduced. {\textcopyright} 2007 ASCE.},

@article{Pfeiffer2017,
abstract = {In many gravel-bedded rivers, floods that fill the channel banks create just enough shear stress to move the median-sized gravel particles on the bed surface (D50). Because this observation is common and is supported by theory, the coincidence of bankfull flow and the incipient motion of D50 has become a commonly used assumption. However, not all natural gravel channels actually conform to this simple relationship; some channels maintain bankfull stresses far in excess of the critical stress required to initiate sediment transport. We use a database of {\textgreater}300 gravel-bedded rivers and {\textgreater}600 10Be-derived erosion rates from across North America to explore the hypothesis that sediment supply drives the magnitude of bankfull shear stress relative to the critical stress required to mobilize the median bed surface grain size ($\tau$bf∗ = $\tau$c∗). We find that $\tau$bf∗ = $\tau$c∗ is significantly higher in West Coast river reaches (2.35, n = 96) than in river reaches elsewhere on the continent (1.03, n = 245). This pattern parallels patterns in erosion rates (and hence sediment supplies). Supporting our hypothesis, we find a significant correlation between upstream erosion rate and local $\tau$bf∗ = $\tau$c∗ at sites where this comparison is possible. Our analysis reveals a decrease in bed surface armoring with increasing $\tau$bf∗ = $\tau$c∗, suggesting channels accommodate changes in sediment supply through adjustments in bed surface grain size, as also shown through numerical modeling. Our findings demonstrate that sediment supply is encoded in the bankfull hydraulic geometry of gravel bedded channels through its control on bed surface grain size.},
