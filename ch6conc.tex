\section{The overall strategy}

This thesis has presented a review and four chapters which generalize and extend earlier work to describe sediment transport as a stochastic process. In the research, I characterized the movements of grains along a wider range of timescales than before, and I developed new a new formalism using these movements to predict the sediment flux.
