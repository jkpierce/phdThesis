Reviewer #2 (Comments to Author (shown to authors):

General Comments: The revised manuscript appropriately addresses the first set of reviews by placing a larger emphasis on the geophysical aspects of the problem. The revised manuscript is suitable for publication following minor revisions or a few changes that could potentially happen within the copy-editing phase.

Specific Comments:

Abstract. The abstract would benefit from some general editing. 7/12 lines are introducing the problem rather than serving as a synopsis of the paper. Some of this would be better suited to the introduction section.

Ln. 64. This is a bit of a miss citaiton here. Both Bradley (2017) and Phillips et al. (2013) only consider time above a transport threshold thus specifically excluding the time spent resting during low flow between floods.

Ln. 278-282. In Weeks and Swinney (1998) long time subdiffusion is uncommon for asymmetric random walks requiring very heavy-tailed waiting times. Given re-entrainment from burial is likely in all but aggrading systems is long term subdiffusion really a viable solution for natural rivers?
