There is no general framework to predict the transport of sediment grains under a fluid flow.   
Given the state of affairs in physics research, this is not surprising.
Fluid flow has been notoriously difficult to understand, as have the dynamics of granular materials.
Presumably, a framework for predicting sediment transport should share elements from existing theories in both fluid and granular dynamics.
In this review article, a key underlying statistical physics  concept, widely applied in both fluid and granular physics contexts, is identified, discussed, and examined for its relevance in describing sediment transport.
