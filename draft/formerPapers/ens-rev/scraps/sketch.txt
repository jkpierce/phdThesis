title: bedload transport from a mechanistic-stochastic frame 
abstract:

introduction:
	-sediment transport matters
	-many attempts to predict it 
	-mechanistic vs phenomenological 
	-deterministic vs stochastic 
	-deterministic approaches have been undermined
	-resurgence of phenomeonological stochastic approaches
	-recent movement toward mechanistic stochastic approaches 
	-this article will review them
sediment transport models: 
	-many investigators have conceptualized the transport of sediment grains
	 as a process with several stages. 
	-this division holds more validity at low transport stages
	-Einsetin originally conceptualized sediment transport as a
	 switching between two phases, motion and rest. 
	-Subsequent investigators concentrating on mechanistic-stochastic 
	 approaches gradually realized the importance of the motion phase in
	 the sediment transport process. 
	-We will follow this division of the sediment transport process into 
	 three phases, entrainment,  motion, and rest, acknowledging its
	 limitations
	-mechanistic stochastic approaches will then be categorized in this 
	 review on the criterion that they involve only entrainment, only 
         motion, or only deposition, versus if they include some switching
         between phases.
