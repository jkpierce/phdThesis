\chapter{Lay Summary}

Predicting the flow rates of gravel through river channels is important to manage environmental issues involving rivers.
Most approaches to predict gravel flow consider gravel as if it were a heavy fluid.
This description oversimplifies the problem, since gravel flow is actually individual grains bouncing and rolling downstream, which is hardly like a fluid.

In this thesis, I consider gravel flow as the result of individual grains. Using physics and probability, I calculate how fast individual grains move downstream, then I demonstrate how to use their downstream movement paths to predict overall gravel flow rates.
This research produces a more realistic description of gravel movement in rivers which helps us understand how rivers change through time.
