# ens-rev

This is a review of sediment transport theories which include ensemble
concepts. It's also my first latex document using a full command line 
workflow with version control. 

* The template comes from https://github.com/kourgeorge/arxiv-style
although it has been modified slightly. In particular I removed 
'preprint' from the title and I changed the header text slightly.  

* The references are formatted agu style using the agu.bst file which
came from http://pordlabs.ucsd.edu/sgille/how_to/papers/agu.bst

* to compile the document type _make all_. The makefile may require 
modification if the section titles change

* to clean out the auxillary files type _./clean_.

* biblio.bib was generated with mendeley. It is a nightmare. 

Ok, I actually changed the topic while conducting the literature review. THe topic is now more along the lines of markov process based sediment transport theory. In particular, a subset of markov processes: ot the random walk models, but instead the models which use continous time discrete state markov processes in order to describe the stochastic or probabilisitic sediment transport rate .c
