\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.2}{\ignorespaces Panel (a) indicates the generalization of Einstein's model to include the interval of sediment motion between entrainment and deposition, now represented with dichotomous noise eq. \ref {eq:lislerando}, while panel (b) shows the tilted stair-step trajectories of sediment particles moving downstream in cycles of motion at velocity $V$ (with mean duration $1/k_D$) and rest (with mean duration $1/k_E$). \relax }}{10}{figure.caption.10}%
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.3}{\ignorespaces Panel (a) demonstrates the trajectory of a particle within the Fan et al model, where Coulomb friction impedes turbulent drag. Panel (b) shows the resulting exponential particle velocity distribution, having relatively large fluctuations with mode at $u=0$. Panel (c) shows the analogous trajectory from the Ancey et al model, where turbulent Stokes drag generates the Gaussian velocity distribution seen in (d). The latter has relatively narrow and symmetric fluctuations, with the mode well above $u=0$.\relax }}{14}{figure.caption.11}%
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.4}{\ignorespaces Particle fluxes can be defined with either a control volume $V$ or a control surface $S$. Here, particles are shown moving from time $t-dt$ (faint white particles) to time $t$ (grey particles). Each particle's velocity component $u_i$ in the downstream direction is indicated. At the instant $t$, the surface definition of the flux \ref {eq:surfflux} gives $q = \frac {1}{L}(u_7+u_8).$, while the volume definition \ref {eq:controlflux} gives $\Phi = \frac {1}{L}(u_1+\dots +u_6)$, showing the non-equivalence of these two definitions.\relax }}{15}{figure.caption.12}%
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.5}{\ignorespaces Einsteinâ€™s conceptual picture (modified from \citet {Yalin1972}). Particles move in discrete jumps of length $\ell $ from left to right through an array of adjacent control volumes. The bedload flux is the rate of bedload particles crossing the surface $S$ per unit width and time, collected from all upstream control volumes.\relax }}{17}{figure.caption.13}%
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.6}{\ignorespaces The scale-dependent sediment flux is described as a renewal process. Panel (a) indicates the arrivals of particles at rate $\Lambda $, while panel (b) shows an ensemble of realizations of the sediment flux versus the observation time $T$. Note that different realizations of the flux converge toward the same value at large observation times, whereas at small observation times, uncertainty in the flux is large. This is observation-scale dependence. The nature of this convergence depends on the particle dynamics in an as yet unspecified way. \relax }}{25}{figure.caption.14}%
\addvspace {10\p@ }
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.1}{\ignorespaces The left panel indicates the configuration for the flux. The particle trajectories within are calculated from equation \ref {eq:langevin}, demonstrating alternation between rest and motion with fluctuating velocity. Particles begin their transport with positions $-L\leq x \leq 0$ at $t=0$, and as depicted in the right panel, the flux is calculated as the number of particles $N_>(t)$ which lie to the right of $x=0$ at the observation time $t$, divided by $t$: $Q(t) = t^{-1}N_>(t)$. We calculate the probability distribution of $Q$ over all realizations of the trajectories and initial positions as $L\rightarrow \infty $\relax }}{36}{figure.caption.15}%
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.2}{\ignorespaces Panel (a) indicates the probability distribution of particle position as it evolves through time. From the initial mixture of motion and rest states, particles advect downstream as they diffuse due to differences in their fluctuating velocities and exchange between motion and rest. Panel (b) shows the resulting particle diffusion. At timescales $t \ll 2D/V^2$, the diffusion is normal since the movement is approximately a standard diffusion process (as advection is irrelevant on these timescales). For larger timescales, $2D/V^2 \ll t \ll \tau $, particles undergo ballistic diffusion similar to \citet {Lisle1998} as a result of some particles being stationary as others advect. Finally longer than the timescale $\tau = 1/k$ associated with entrainment and deposition, diffusion is again normal, exemplified by exchange between motion and rest. All results are scaled by the mean hop length $l=V/k_D$ and the autocorrelation time $\tau =1/k$ of the motion/rest alternation.\relax }}{39}{figure.caption.16}%

Migration, entrainment, and deposition are represented by arrows, and the instantaneous bed elevation is depicted by dotted lines. The bed is displayed in a degraded state, where $m<0$. The marginal distributions of $n$ and $m$ are indicated in the upper right panel, while the bottom panel is a realized time-series of bed elevations computed from $m$ using (\ref {eq:ele}).\relax }}{51}{figure.caption.18}%
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.2}{\ignorespaces Panel (a) presents the probability distribution of particle activity $n$ and panel (b) presents the probability distribution of the relative number of particles $m$ for a representative subset of simulations. These distributions represent different flows from table \ref {tab:anceyparams}, distinguished by color, and different values of the active layer depth $l$ (equivalently the coupling constant $\kappa $), distinguished by the marker style. The mean field theories (mft) of equations (\ref {eq:ancey}) and (\ref {eq:ou2}) are displayed as solid black lines.\relax }}{59}{figure.caption.20}%

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.4}{\ignorespaces The shifts between particle activity moments conditioned on instantaneous elevations and their over-all mean values. Panel (a) indicates the mean particle activity shift versus the bed elevation measured in units of $\sigma _z=l$. This shift displays asymmetric dependence on $m$ at the flow conditions of the \citet {Ancey2008} experiements, and departures of the bedload transport mean can be as much as 60\% when the bed is in a severely degraded state with $z\approx -3l$. The closure equation (\ref {eq:closure}) is plotted in panel (a) Panel (b) demonstrates a more symmetrical variance shift with some dependence on flow conditions displaying shifts of up to 20\% with bed elevations. These results indicate that bedload statistics measurements on short timesclaes could be severely biased by departures from the mean bed elevation.\relax }}{61}{figure.caption.22}%
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.5}{\ignorespaces The shift of the mean particle activity in panel (a) and its fluctuations in panel (b) with departures of the bed elevation from its mean. All simulations are at flow condition (g) from table \ref {tab:anceyparams} except $\lambda $ and $\mu $ are modified to shift the fraction $f=\mu /\sigma $ of the over-all entrainment rate $E$ due to collective entrainment. Clearly, collective entrainment drives strong departures of the bedload statistics away from the mean field model (\ref {eq:ancey}) at large departures from the mean bed elevation. Panel (b) shows particle activity fluctuations suppressed by 90\% when $z\approx -3l$ and collective entrainment is the dominant process. When collective entrainment is absent, meaning $\mu /\sigma =0$, this moment regulation effect vanishes: it is a consequence of collective entrainment.\relax }}{62}{figure.caption.23}%
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.6}{\ignorespaces Resting time statistics scale differently with transport conditions and the bed elevation variance. Panel (a) shows differing flow conditions at a fixed $l$ value, while panel (c) shows fixed flow conditions at differing $l$. When scaled by $T_0$ (\ref {eq:time}), both types of difference collapse in the tails of the distributions, as shown in panels (b) and (d). In panels (b) and (d), the black dotted lines indicate a power law decay of the collapsed tails having parameter $\alpha \approx 1.18$ .\relax }}{63}{figure.caption.24}%

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4.1}{\ignorespaces Joint distributions for a grain to be at position $x$ at time $t$ are displayed for the choice $k_1=0.1$, $k_2=1.0$, $v=2.0$. Grains are considered initially at rest ($\theta _1=1$, $\theta _2=0$). The solid lines are the analytical distribution in equation (\ref {eq:pdf}), while the points are numerically simulated, showing the correctness of our derivations. Colors pertain to different times. Units are unspecified, since we aim to demonstrate the general characteristics of $p(x,t)$. Panel (a) shows the case $\kappa =0$ -- no burial. In this case, the joint distribution tends toward Gaussian at large times \citep {Einstein1937,Lisle1998}. Panel (b) shows the case when grains have rate $\kappa = 0.01$ to become buried while resting. Because of burial, the joint distribution tends toward a more uniform distribution than Gaussian. \relax }}{76}{figure.caption.25}%
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4.2}{\ignorespaces Panel (a) sketches conceptual trajectories of three grains, while panel (b) depicts the variance (\ref {eq:var}) with mean motion time $1.5$ s, resting time $30.0$ s, and movement velocity $0.1$ m/s -- values comparable to laboratory experiments transporting small ($5$ mm) gravels \citep {Lajeunesse2010,Martin2012}. The burial timescale is $7200.0$s (two hours), and grains start from rest ($\theta _1=1$). The solid line is equation (\ref {eq:var}), and the points are numerically simulated. Panel (b) demonstrates four distinct scaling ranges of $\sigma _x^2$: local, intermediate, global, and geomorphic. The first three are diffusive. Three crossover times $\tau _L$, $\tau _I$, and $\tau _G$ divide the ranges. Within each range, a slope key demonstrates the scaling $\sigma _x^2 \propto t^\gamma $. Panel (a) demonstrates that different mixtures of motion, rest, and burial states generate the ranges. At local timescales, grains usually either rest or move; at intermediate timescales, they transition between rest and motion; at global timescales, they transition between rest, motion, and burial; and at geomorphic timescales, all grains bury. Additional slope keys in the local and global ranges of panel (b) illustrate the effect of initial conditions and rest/burial timescales on the diffusion, while the additional slope key within the geomorphic range demonstrates the expected scaling when burial is not permanent, as we discuss in section \ref {sec:discussion}. \relax }}{79}{figure.caption.27}%
