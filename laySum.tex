\chapter{Lay Summary}

Predicting the movement of gravel through river channels is important to manage environmental issues involving rivers, since moving gravel can destabilize river channels.
A majority of models assume gravel flows as if it were a heavy fluid, but this description is crude considering how gravel actually moves.
In this thesis, I instead describe gravel movement as the result of individual grains bouncing and rolling along the streambed.
Using this concept, I calculate the downstream flow rate of gravel, study how this flow rate depends on the shape of the bed, and predict how quickly individual grains move downstream.
This research produces a more realistic description of how gravel moves in river channels which helps us understand how rivers change through time.
