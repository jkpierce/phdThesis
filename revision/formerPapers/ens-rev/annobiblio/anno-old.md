# Dey Papanicola 2008 (sediment treshold review) -- reviews white 1940 which introduced a turbulence factor characterizing the
 difference between instantaneous and mean flows (i.e. T is just sigma) "Wu and Chou (2003) studied the rolling and lifting probabilities for sediment entrainment by incorporating the probabilistic features of the turbulent fluctuation and bed particle
 geometry."; "Gessler 1977 (estimate of probability to remain stationary" ; "Mingmin and Qiwei (1982) developed a stochastic model 
for the incipient motion of sediment particles"; "Wu and Chou (2003) studied the rolling and lifting probabilities for sediment entrainment by incorporating the probabilistic features of the turbulent fluctuation and bed particle geometry. These probabilities
 were linked to the two separate criteria for incipient motion to explore the critical entrainment probabilities. The critical entrainment probabilities are highly variable functions of the particle Reynolds number. Thus, an inconsistent probability
 corresponding to the critical particle entrainment was found." There wasapparently a resurgence of interest in stochastic approaches following the turbulent bursting observation of Kline (1967). ". In an attempt to link the characteristics of turbulent
 episodes with the initial entrainment of sediment, several researchers (e.g., Nelson et al., 1995; Clifford et al.,1991) suggested that the Reynolds stress component  is not the most relevant component to sediment entrainment. Recently, the studies of Krogstad
 et al. (1992), and Papanicolaou et al. (2001) provided further evidence that the presence of bed packing conditions in gravel bed 
streams affects the turbulence characteristics of the flow and as a result the entrainment of sediment." Church 1978 notes that densely packed and loosely packed beds support differently behaving flows. "Papanicolaou et al. (2001) shows that the ratio of the
 Reynolds stress to the standard deviation of the downstream velocity is smaller in the low-density cases than the densely packed cases." Clearly there is something about bed porosity that affects the overlying flow.  There is a strong empirical argument that bed porosity affects the flow. "Hence, incipient motion criteria based solely on time-averaged bed shear stress may under-predict
 transport, especially in low-density packing cases" " (Θ c and R * ) on sediment threshold reported by Gilbert (1914), Casey  (1935), Kramer (1935), Shields (1936), USWES (1936), White (1940), Vanoni (1946), Meyer-Pe er and Müller (1948), Iwagaki (1956),
 Neill (1967), Grass (1970), White (1970), Karahan (1975), Mantz (1977) and Yalin and Karahan (1979)" "James (1990) presented a generalized model of sediment threshold for nonuniform sediments based on an analysis of moments of forces acting on a sediment particle." "Dey and Zanke (2004) modified the threshold model of Dey (1999) applicable to the sediment threshold by the stream flow
 subject to upward seepage."

 spinning motion of particle. The model proposed by him has two limits – rolling and lifting. The value of lift Vol. 12, No. 1 / January 2008 Fig. 10. Dependency of Θ c on Particle Parameter d̃ for Different φ coefficient was assumed as 1.615, although it is not a constant in reality. He considered a depth-averaged method for the estimation of mean flow velocity received by a solitary particle. However, an area-averaged method is the most accurate one as the averaging is done over the whole projected area of the particle, being right angles to the direction of flow. The limitation of this model is that it is not applicable to non-uniform 
sediments."
